"My nationality is US so my question is related to US tax laws.  My question is related to non-retirement related investiment.  It is just for a regular investment account.

Last year I have 6000USD of tax loss carried over into this.

So far, my portfolio has realized gains and losses.  I can just sell stocks/bonds for $6000 profit tax free due to being offset by the losses right?  Since my bank doesn't charge transaction fees, I am thinking about just selling them to turn unrealized gains into realized gains and buy them right back.  

The confusing part of it all is the deal related to long term vs short term.  Because my 6000USD tax loss comes from bonds which I held for more than 6 months, so to cancel those out, my profit has to be long term capital gains?",End of the year tax gain/loss question,18ngc8h,1703139785.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/18ngc8h/end_of_the_year_tax_gainloss_question/,
"At 1:30pm ET today, SPY hit $475.73 and decisively broke downwards for the day. At 2:05pm ET, it fell below yesterday's close at $474.84, from there it waterfalled all the way to $468.26.

This was a major and abrupt 1.5% slide from the highs of the day.

# Why did it sell off?

First of all, it's without a doubt that the stock market has been overheated for a while now. SPY is hitting all-time-highs, other indices are hitting resistance, fintech stocks are pumping to Mars. In some ways, it feels like we're back in 2020-2021.

However, it's important to note that an overheated market is not a reason to sell. ATHs are often bullish signals, else the indices wouldn't be where we are today.While the exact reason of the sell-off can't be known by us outsiders, there are reasonable speculations. A major one is the selling of 1 million open SPY $475 call options that triggered the sell-off of the index. This sudden spike in selling pressure triggered a cascade of selling as 0-dte options gamblers cut losses and institutions bailed from the market.

This is just one speculation, but a plausible one and backed by market data.

However, we also have to give credit to a negative macroeconomic backdrop. The closing off of the Suez Canal for global shipping due to Houthi aggression in the Red Sea is alarming for inflation. Ships have to divert a long distance around the horn of Africa, significantly increasing time and cost to final destination. Add to this the poor Fedex earnings report from yesterday in which the stock fell over 10%, as well as the already significantly overheated markets, and it's clear there's a growing wall of anxiety in the market. No wonder all it took is a spike in selling for the market to sell off in a big way.Hindsight is 20/20 but that doesn't mean we can't learn from the past.

# So what happens next?

You can be in one of two camps from here. One camp thinks this is a healthy bull market pullback and we'll consolidate around here or below before rocketing back up again.

The second camp thinks that the market is yet to appreciate the full effects of the closing of the Suez Canal, as well as the economic canary in the coal mine from Fedex's earnings report, and this is the start of another major pullback.

The prudent thing to do is to reduce risk, monitor the market and the geopolitical situation, then decide your next move. The situation right now is unknown and highly dynamic and any big bets at this point is premature.

If I had to pick a side, I think this is just a healthy bull market pullback.",Why Did the Market Sell-Off?,18ncwvv,1703128379.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/18ncwvv/why_did_the_market_selloff/,
"When exactly is the best time to buy? I’ve heard stuff like buy low, sell high, you can’t time the market, time in the market is better than timing the market, don’t buy a stock at its peak. Some of these “lines” kinda go against each other.


So i guess my question is, do I buy weekly no matter the price? Wait for a dip? Wait for the stock to be a fair price/bargain? 


Can stocks like Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon even be bought at a bargain, or a fair price?

"Hey everyone  
  
I want to open a discussion about the future of AI in the investment world and I'd love to get your thoughts on a specific aspect.  
  
As we are seeing more and more AI driven tools for investment, here's the dilemma:  
  
**Build Your Own AI Model:** This option allows investors to create and fine-tune their own AI models. It's all about personalization, where you get to decide the factors, markets, and risk levels that the AI should consider. It's a bit like crafting your own investment strategy, but with a techy, AI-driven twist.  
  
**Use a Premade AI Model:** This is the plug-and-play option. An AI model that's already been built and trained, ready for you to use. All you need to do is invest based on the model’s recommendations. It’s simpler, but with less flexibility and personal input.  
  
Would you guys be more inclined to build your own AI model, tailoring it to your specific investment philosophy?  
Or, would you prefer the convenience and ease of a premade AI model, even if it means less customization?

"i know TQQQ gets rebalanced every day so that the 3x leverage is only 3x day to day rather than over time, making TQQQ ideal for trading rather than holding, but what am i missing here? why not hold it anyway? over the last 5 years TQQQ is up 364% vs QQQ’s 152.5%. thats still 138% outperformance. so it hasnt returned 3x returns over 5 years, but still has returned 2.38x which isnt bad at all. i know QQQ has a dividend and TQQQ doesnt, but its pretty small and definitely not enough to offset QQQ’s relative under performance. and i know 3x works when it goes up as well as when it goes down so downturns will hurt more if i hold TQQQ rather than QQQ, but if i plan to hold for years and years to come, then that just means buying opportunities (dips) will be even bigger discounts.

somebody tell me why i’m wrong. there has to be a reason more people dont pile into TQQQ but do pile into QQQ to hold for longterm. is it just risk appetite and they dont want to deal with 3x downturns? im 23 so i still have plenty of time to be able to afford high risk so i would be okay with 3x downturns assuming im not missing something big here.",investing in QQQ vs TQQQ for the longterm,18n4fqh,1703104304.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/18n4fqh/investing_in_qqq_vs_tqqq_for_the_longterm/,
"I get the gist of what Payment for Order Flow (PFOF) is: the broker partners with a market maker to process the transaction, with allows the market maker to pocket the bid-ask spread and to front-run trades (are these the same thing?). The market maker pays the broker for this privilege, which typically allows the broker to operate without trade commissions. But the bid-ask spread basically acts like an indirect commission (albeit small) since the buyer is paying slightly more than the true price.

The information I haven't been able to find is:

* What is the effective average 'cost' of PFOF?
* Are ETFs included in PFOF and also have an effective cost to trade?
* Is there a limit to the effective cost of PFOF? Can the effective cost change/surge unexpectedly to much higher levels than normal?
* Which brokerage firms engage in PFOF? Are there any that do not?
* Is there a good way of avoiding/boycotting the PFOF system?
* If PFOF is banned, what would happen to brokers whose business models rely on PFOF? Is there any risk for investors given SIPC protection?

The reason why I want to know this information is I am finally ditching Northwestern Mutual in favor of low cost trading somewhere else. I am attracted to Robinhood because of the IRA 1-3% contribution match (and no commissions), but am starting to learn about the ugly truth of PFOF.

I grew up working with my dad from the age of 8 during summer and on days off, when i got a job at 16, most of that money went to helping with bills around the house, my parents never owned a home, and come christmas time, it was often clothes with a nice gift here or there. There were months were i paid rent with only $10 left in my bank account for weeks, So the fact that i am in the position i am in today is just scary to think about since no one i can turn too has experience in this, but WOW does it feel good. It is amazing to be in this position too and i know i will not follow in my parents footsteps.

"I have always believed in the efficient market hypothesis and that trading is a zero EV endeavor minus commissions and taxes.  I am up huge lifetime because I started in 2003, always went long, never traded financials, and was away on sabatical from 2008 to 2009. I am probably the luckiest person alive.

I do three types of trades: hedging my long term SPY with puts, trading futures to gain exposure and increase diversification, going long on individuals companies in the OEX. I do not believe in technical analysis. I am 100% certain it is astrology for men.

I also do not believe I am capable of fundamental or macro analysis on anything. I have 10,000 hours of macro study and I am certain it does not even give me a .1% edge.

My most profitable trades have been on illiquid LEAP OOM options on OEX companies with spreads greater than 25%.  I have been filled multiple times, but sometimes it can take six months or more to get filled creating re-investment risk.  I feel i have run in the top 5% of luck getting these fills, but there is only reinvestment risk so it is very manageable.

Futures trading is my ultimate drug. After twenty years I am flat minus about 2k commissions. But its more of a hobby than anything. I am a big fan of the ultra ten year, swiss franc, nat gas, and more recently shorting the CME cash settled bitcoin futures (not an ad lol). It is obvious to anyone with sense it is impossible for anyone to have an edge over these ultra liquid markets, but the diversity is nice.

"Hello all. I have a house and elected to pay my own taxes and insurance (no escrow). Before interest rates started increasing, I just calculated my taxes/insurance requirement for the year, direct deposited a portion of every paycheck I received to a HYSA and then paid my property taxes and insurance at the end of January.

This past year, I experimented with putting that chunk of money in a Fidelity account instead of the HYSA and every time I accrued more than $1000, I bought a CD or treasury that was scheduled to expire before Jan 31 of the next year. Importantly, I never intended to or actually sold the cd/treasury. I let everything I bought mature, so the liquidity markets did not matter to my strategy. 

I’m wondering what people think of this strategy generally. I believe I averaged better than if I had used a HYSA, but I also fully admit this is more “work” than if I had just left it all in the HYSA or something like SPAXX. Having said that, it takes ten minutes once a month to review the account and grab whatever the best yield is and lock it in.

Over my entire career (probably another 20-25 years), I intend to leave any excess returns in the account in the hopes my excess returns can cover the increases to my taxes and insurance due to inflation, eliminating any need to increase how much I have to deposit per paycheck.

I, like many others, realized capital losses last year in excess of what I am allowed to claim. So I can use $3k of last year's capital losses to offset gains from this year. As it's approaching end of year, I want to make sure I do this wisely.

I have realized long-term and short-term capital gains this year in excess of $3,000. I also have unrealized long term and short term capital losses in excess of those amounts I could use this year.

Because long-term gains are more tax friendly than short-term gains, I want to ensure the $3k of losses I roll over to this year are used to cancel out short-term gains. Does anyone know if this will automatically happen, if I am able to designate this, or if they will automatically cancel out the long term gains?

"Not that I trust the first article I read but saw this on CNN today. Jack Manley, global market strategist at JPMorgan says that active investing is the way to go in 2024. I am curious to know what folks on this thread think.

[https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/19/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/19/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html)

It’s all about active management   
  
A common theme across 2024 outlooks is that investors will do well to actively manage their portfolios next year. That’s a bit different than the ‘set it and forget it’ long-run investment advice that typically prevails among portfolio managers.  
  
Stocks and bonds have been unusually volatile this year, behaving in ways that aren’t consistent with economic expectations, wrote Jack Manley, global market strategist at JPMorgan. Given those “significant dislocations,” he said “simply owning the indices will not suffice.”  
  
That means an investment strategy that relies on broad market movements to generate returns, rather than on specific stock selection or other active management strategies, may fall short.  
  
“Investors need to take a more active approach to their portfolios. This is not a time to switch on the investing autopilot; it’s a time to take the controls,” wrote analysts at BlackRock. “It’s important to be deliberate in taking portfolio risk, in our view, and we expect to deploy more risk over the next year.”",Active Investing?

This has done me really well over the years, but I've had recent doubts after chatting to a (supposedly) finance-savvy friend of mine. He advised me that although my money was in an index fund, and therefore automatically diversified amongst sectors, that my geographical diversification was poor and I should consider investing in something like VEUR to get some exposure to european markets. 

Is this good advice? I'm a little skeptical, since this would mean investing in a new index fund rather than just pumping more money into the, historically lucrative, S&amp;P500. Is this a good idea? If so, what would be the ideal split of my portfolio between these two funds?",Is it good practice to diversify already diversified index funds even further?,18m1a4q,1702990651.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/18m1a4q/is_it_good_practice_to_diversify_already/,
"All,

Have had this on my watchlist for a while and recently bought 100 stocks. I have some more cash and was wondering if investing more makes sense or not. Below is my reasoning for MBG.

- current price: ~63
- 52 week high: ~76
- 52 week low: ~55
- dividend yield: ~8%
- P/E: 4.5 (5 year average ~11)

Now looking at financials:

Revenue growth 5Y: -1.8%.
Gross margin: 22.8% with 5 year avg of 20.8%
Operating margin: 12% with 5 year avg of 7.2%
Net profit margin: 10% with 5 year avg of 5.6%

Though revenues have stagnated in last 5 years, they are expected to grow revenues to 165 billion euros by 2027. Improving margins should strongly boost their bottom line.

Free cash flow generated over last 5 years is about 28 billion ( annual  avg of about 5.6 billion). In 9 months in 2023 itself , free cash flow is about 5 billion euros.

Conclusion:

Considering that EU will protect its automobile industry from cheap Chinese cars, and MBG has a strong footing in luxury cars, I feel that this stock is a strong buy. Given inflation and recessionary outlook, growth is limited in the short term but they are improving their fundamentals and margins. Over last 3 years, they have generated strong and healthy cash flows and the 8% dividend is cherry on top.",Mercedes Benz group: Thoughts?,18m0010,1702986318.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/18m0010/mercedes_benz_group_thoughts/,

"Thoughts on this portfolio?

My thought process for this portfolio is this: 

I like having the VOO in there for steady reliable growth so that’s why that’s at 20%. And when looking at the top companies (right now) within the S&amp;P 500 they are mostly tech. I honestly don’t see these companies disappearing off the map like a lot of tech companies did back in the internet boom. I think they have secured a foothold to be around for a good while. That being said that’s why I allocated another 20% in VGT which focuses and has higher weights on these top tech companies (see second photo which shows weights on companies in S&amp;P 500 and how tech dominates the top 20 or so). To balance out the rest of the portfolio I have both SCHD and SCHG. I wanted to have a strong dividend ETF In there so hence the SCHD at 40% and then finally I threw in SCHG at 20% for some potential large growth, albeit higher risk as well.

My company with over 2000 employees recently went public and has offered and ESPP.

We can contribute 1-10% of our base salary and the company will match 15% of the contributions.

Is this a no brainer? I need some proper guidance.

So i asked the HR and this is how it goes—


How do l estimate what my per pay deduction will be?

Take your annual base salary e.g, $40,000
Divide this by 24 pay periods = $1,666.67 per pay period


Decide how much you want to contribute e.g., 10% Your contribution = 10% × 1,666.67 = $166.67 per pay The company will match 15% = 15% × 166.67 = $25.00


Your net pay will be reduced by $166.66 plus tax on the company match. (if you are in the 27% tax bracket this means ~$6.75 in tax)


At the end of the offering period (6 pays in a quarter) you will have accumulated

"Sometimes I wonder if the popular push for middle class investors to DCA invest in passive index funds is a “do as I say, not as I do” recommendation when coming from wealthy investors. The wealthy seem to use cash reserves quite often to buy up equities, from stock to real estate, during economic downturns—something that I at least understand to be one of the drivers of contemporary wealth inequality.

I guess the point could be that these people are ALSO investing in the market and that this buying with cash reserves is additional spending. Could also be some survivorship bias.

Obviously an emergency fund and getting an employers 401K match would be a priority, but after that, it seems hard to beat a guaranteed tax-free ""return"" of 7%.

I ask because we bought a smaller house before the market went nuts and had two kids since, and realized the schools we're zoned for are pretty awful, plus we'd like a bigger house now that we have kids. We thought we were being financially smart by purchasing a smaller house than we could afford. We got what we needed at the time, assuming we'd be able to upgrade, if needed. But now we're kinda screwed and are going to have almost 3x the mortgage rate if we move. Investing made sense when the house loan was cheap, but if we do decide to move, I feel like I'd just need to throw money at the new house until it was fully paid off.

Also, what's the consensus on what to do if you currently have a low-interest loan house, but need/want to move. Keep it and rent it out, while taking out a larger mortgage on the new house, or sell it so you can put more money towards the new house and have a lower high-interest rate mortgage?

Maybe it's not possible. I'm interested in what you think is the best option but also in the range of options available, and any substitutes that I might be missing.

For example, let's say we have a bank account and we want to keep $1000 in it. At the end of each month, it will have between $500 and $2000 in it. At that point, f there's anything above that $1000, we want to move it automatically into a money market mutual fund or similar place.

"Hi all, I am a former VMware (VMW) employee, now part of Broadcom (AVGO), after the recent acquisition. E-Trade is the brokerage handling employee shares for VMware, and consequently the distribution of shares + cash after the deal closed.

I had elected 100% share conversions to AVGO for my 4.5 years of ESPP and vested RSU. More shares vested after the initial election, and I elected them to be converted to 100% AVGO as well.

The acquisition deal closed end of November, the payout ratio was determined as 52% share conversion to AVGO and 48% cash. Instead of honoring the stock conversion ratio that was decided, all my shares have been cashed out by E-Trade. We know of at least 55 confirmed employees affected by this issue, and about 100-150 have indicated they might have been affected.

I happen to have screenshots of my elections.

E-Trade has been telling inconsistent stories to the affected people. Primarily, that we needed to elect the entirety of the original election again while making the second election, because the second election overwrote the first election. Which I have proof of that there was no option to do so. The second election only allowed the newly vested shares to be elected, and after the election, as per the screenshot and their UI, the quantity of shares remaining to choose election was 0. The folks who were not affected by this issue only made elections for the newly vested shares as well.

E-Trade has been dismissing everyone who's been calling them, and we've been doing that almost daily. They are saying they cannot do anything. They haven't yet officially closed the complaint we have written to them.

At an individual level,

1. It's an outright value loss of \~$52/share based on the effective share price at the payout ratio of 52:48. That amounts to tens of thousands of dollars for me.
2. I have to pay more taxes now for all the liquid cash.

If I have about $200k in a HYSA getting 5% but want exposure to broad index funds for diversification and higher potential return, how do I go about “timing” it? It would seem unwise to dump $150k of it immediately into a three-fund portfolio as I don’t get any DCA benefits. But I feel like the longer I wait the longer that money sits making returns well below something like VTI. 

I totally understand that 2023 has been a bull year for equities and I know that we can never time the market so I do not want to “wait for a recession” - so do I dump it all in just at once? Do I do $10k a month for 15 months? How am I able to figure out the best way to do this?

"You've all probably heard the stories on Bitcoin's value. Stories that portray Bitcoin not only as valuable, but precious. Stories by which buying bitcoins is one of the smartest things you can do. Well, all of that is just cheap propaganda. A bait to lure you to buy something worthless.

Bitcoins cannot be eaten or drunk. They cannot be seen like artwork or heard like music. They cannot be used to operate computers and execute specific tasks like computer software. They cannot be driven like a car or worn like jewelry. In short, bitcoins have no intrinsic value. When you buy them, you only get a short record, e.g. '5.1234 BTC'.

If someone issued a record and offered it to the public, they must redeem it. The record has to have redemption value. Casino chips, fiat currencies, shares, or gift cards are examples of such records. When you hold them, all you can see is a short string of characters written on a digital, plastic or paper media. There is nothing intrinsically valuable to consume or utilize. That's why their issuers must redeem them for something.

Casinos redeem their chips for cash. Banks redeem their currencies for debt servicing and liens release. Namely, the units of fiat currencies are issued as debt owed to banks - individuals and companies owe it to commercial banks based on loans, while governments owe it to central banks based on bonds. That's why the banks redeem deposits and banknotes for reducing or closing that debt and releasing liens on the property that secures it. Corporations, if they decide to end their business operations, redeem their shares for funds from liquidated assets. Finally, retailers redeem their gift cards for goods or services.

On the other hand, Satoshi Nakamoto, as the issuer of bitcoins, does not redeem them. He issues them through the protocol he wrote, but never redeems from anyone. If you invested electricity to make his system work and got bitcoins for it, Nakamoto won't redeem them even for a dime. Everyone who holds bitcoins knows this. They know that bitcoins have neither redemption nor intrinsic value. They know that bitcoins are worthless. That is why they are forced to get rid of them. Sell them to someone else. And to do this successfully, they need to publicly promote Bitcoin as valuable. They need to compare it to gold, diamonds or artwork. They must say it is the superior version of fiat currencies or money in general. That it can save us from greedy banks. That it is revolutionary like the Internet. That it is scarce. That it solves corruption or financial and economic problems. That it can lift poor countries out of poverty. They need to sugarcoat Bitcoin.

All these stories are of course ridiculous. They would be such even if bitcoins were units of equity, like shares or units of debt, like fiat currencies. But bitcoins are the units of the number 21 million. Nakamoto came up with it in his imagination and assignes its units to online addresses with the protocol he wrote. The whole thing is essentially an online game that uses numbers to simulate bank deposits. The numbers are stored in a decentralized database.

Numbers, whether they are stored centrally or decentrally, don't have magical powers. They cannot solve corruption, play the role of artwork or precious metals, lift countries out of poverty, save us from banks, or be scarce. They cannot be money if they are non-redeemable because there's nothing to compare with the value of goods and services. Those who make up or repeat such stories know very well they are ridiculous. But they do it out of necessity. They bought something worthless and want to get rid of it at as high a price as possible. They want as many participants as possible to enter the scheme, so that wide demand secures them good selling prices. That is what the stories on Bitcoin's value are all about.",The Stories on Bitcoin's value,18l2hsd,1702882206.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/18l2hsd/the_stories_on_bitcoins_value/,
"Hi all - I currently have a pretty passive investing strategy (sp 500 index funds, some bond indexes, and etfs), but I was contacted by Fidelity about investing in an active managed fund they offer. I have traditionally stayed away from these types of funds based on the logic that the management fees are not worth whatever benefit they may offer trying to “beat the market”.

However, the presented pitch was that this fund is not attempting to beat the market on straight returns, but is instead aiming to provide maximum returns through a reduced tax strategy based on strategic buying and selling of stock. The fund data I have reviewed from fidelity shows a return about 1% higher than benchmark after management fees (the fee is .4%).

"I didn't read the whole book as after a point I personally felt that it was repeating its principles. But whatever I read, I learnt from it a lot.

# 10% - The price you pay

Key take away is that ""A PART OF ALL YOU EARN IS YOURS TO KEEP"". And precisely it is 10%. 10% of your income is yours to keep where you will employ that money to make money for yourself consistently.

We can argue that we are not able to make meets end, needs are growing with increasing/stuck income. If you are not in debt and still you got to complain about 10% then there is something that needs to be sorted out because if you want to be wealthy, you have to pay yourself first. And that is 10% of what you make.

""Live below your means"". That t-shirt can wait. Maybe that trip can wait. All these can wait until you pay yourself 10% first.

Note that you won't become too wealthy from it. Compounding returns will need time. Much more time. To live by this thought, look up to Warren Buffet who got his &gt; 90% of networth after he was 50 years. It took him a long time, from 10 years old to 50 years old to have this crazy compounding.

Second emphasis that I have noted in book is ""taking advice from wise people who knows how to manage and multiply money"".

This is so true in our time because there are lots and lots of scammers who lure you in for hefty profits &amp; once you are trapped, your money is gone.

Finding wise people is as hard as making profits in derivatives market where 95% people took loss and remaining 5%'s profit had 15-50% of transaction fees.

But looking back and retrace the path that ""wise"" people have taken throughout their lifetime is beneficial and that ""looking back and learning from that"" is nothing but ""learning from their success &amp; failures""

# Conclusion

Although there ARE many learnings which I have missed but I have shared what I relate most.

Personally I was only saving 3-4% of my income by excusing myself about the ""needs"" that I have to fullfill. But after reading this, I have pledged my 10% income to be mine and only mine which would go to investments in several mechanisms.

And another measure that I have taken is to educate myself from the wise. Reading about investors, their strategies and watching courses.

I would be back with my personal learnings on ""The Psychology of Money"" once I am ready.","Here is what I learnt from ""The richest man in Babylon""",18kgd08,1702816199.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/18kgd08/here_is_what_i_learnt_from_the_richest_man_in/,

"Is this supposed to happen? I have opened maybe 5 brokerage/retirement accounts over lifetime and I've never had a hard credit inquiry from those.

"Unlike coverdell ESA (education savings account), I understand you do not have to withdraw from your 529 in the same year that the expense is incurred. In fact you can wait until any point afterwards, perhaps several years, before withdrawing.

If true then it seems the 529 could be treated like a HSA. You leave it in, let it grow, and only withdraw later with your saved college expense receipts. If you have money left over you can pass it down to your kids.

Is anyone aware of this or was I misinformed?

\--

Update: thanks all for your comments - it seems I was misinformed. Additional point here:   


When it comes to 529 plan withdrawals, it's essential to align the timing of the distributions with the year in which the qualifying educational expenses are incurred. This requirement isn't explicitly stated as an IRS rule, but it is strongly implied by published IRS guidance and agreed upon by tax professionals.  
  
The rationale behind this timing alignment is to prevent potential misuse of 529 plans. For example, if funds in a 529 plan are allowed to grow tax-deferred over an extended period and then withdrawn to pay for expenses incurred in a previous year, it could lead to financial benefits that the plan isn't designed to provide. This practice could potentially be seen as an abuse of the tax advantages of 529 plans.",529 college savings plan - do you treat it like a HSA?,18kb9lp,1702795238.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/18kb9lp/529_college_savings_plan_do_you_treat_it_like_a/,

"Is this what distinguishes the dollar from other currencies? People will often say the dollar retains hegemony as the worlds reserve currency because of things like it is backed by the US military, that it is the most stable, that US citizens and residents need it to pay taxes, and while I think there is truth to all these points, I think the real reason the US dollar has retained hegemony is by virtue of the fact you can't invest in US equities without dollars. 

This goes for international investors, but the real driving force is the domestic market. Whenever the money supply expands due to monetary policy from the central bank, or a commercials bank issuing a loan, one way or another, that money after being taxed several times, transacted several times, eventually finds its way to the equities market. 

Unlike other countries where if their money supply expands, the money is primarily spent on consumer goods and services. 

So this means that the more vibrant a countries' equity market is, the less likely it is to experience inflation even if it has stimulative monetary policy.

"From a numbers standpoint, we are near all time highs. I definitely agree with that notion. However, isn’t the stock market technically supposed to be about an average return (over time) 7% ABOVE inflation? 

We have had a cumulative \~22.80% inflation since Jan 2020 (according to truflation), and we are still barely away from the all time highs of 2021 (which WAS overvalued in my opinion). However, inflation caught up to us, and technically, being at the same level in 2021 account for inflation does not make it seem like the market is overvalued, but more in line with inflation adjusted returns.

Am I seeing this wrongly? It seems any drop would also have to account for 22% inflation, in which the money is already devalued. If we were to stay at the same spot we were when the market was say (sp500 particularly) at 4700, you would be in inflation adjusted terms \~3700 (with 22% inflation).

"Exploring the Concept of Using a HELOC to Accelerate Mortgage Payoff: Seeking Investor Insights and Personal Experiences

I've come across intriguing content on YouTube and various platforms that proposes a financial strategy involving the use of a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) to both cover living expenses and accelerate the repayment of a mortgage. While this approach seems unconventional and potentially rewarding, it also raises red flags regarding its inherent risks and potential complications.

As investors, we are accustomed to assessing risk and reward in various financial endeavors. The notion of relying on a HELOC to sustain one's lifestyle while simultaneously paying down a mortgage faster appears to be a high-stakes maneuver. I'm keen to delve into the experiences of this community to gain a deeper understanding of the practicalities and challenges associated with such a strategy.

For those who have explored or implemented this financial approach, could you share your insights? What were the tangible outcomes, both positive and negative? Were there unforeseen challenges that emerged during the process? How did this strategy influence your overall financial stability and impact your investment portfolio?

Recognizing the subjectivity of personal finance decisions, I believe that a collective exchange of experiences within this community will provide nuanced perspectives for those contemplating a similar course of action. This discussion aims to dissect the risks, benefits, and intricacies tied to using a HELOC as a tool for hastening mortgage repayment. Your firsthand accounts will undoubtedly serve as valuable guideposts for individuals navigating the complexities of this intriguing but potentially precarious financial landscape. Let's foster an insightful conversation that enriches our collective understanding and aids those navigating this uncharted territory.

"If the latest craze on Wall Street -- private credit -- sounds familiar, that's because it's largely a new label on an old wine.

I have a 401k loan (I know many folks disagree with taking these, but what’s done is done) that’s about 1/2 of the way paid up. I just learned that my company is looking into changing from Vanguard to a different company to handle our retirement accounts.

"Hey Investing group.   
Feel silly for asking, but would it be a better investment to reduce my 401k contribution from 15% per paycheck to 5% (for company match), and use the allocated funds to payoff current debt ?

Current Salary - $65k - (Avg 4-5% increase per year)

* Current Debt: 
   * $40k - student loans (3.5 - 6.5% Interest - $300 month payment)
   * $1.4K - personal loan (12% interest -$100/m)
   * $1.1K -  Financed Loan (8% interest -$100/m )
   * 320K - mortgage + utilities ($1800/m)

It seems trivial to utilize the allocated funds towards the mortgage at this time. Mostly looking at the Student loans and personal loans. Part of me feels like the reduction will not be worth it and should keep the investment going. I hate feeling like the ""bare min"" is ever going to get the student loans and such taken care of though. Also feel like 3months of ""emergency funds is not sufficient right now.

I've recently been toying with the idea of going 100% globally diversified small cap value. If one has a sufficiently long time, incredibly steady income, and is not bothered by extended periods of underperforming the S&amp;P 500... why not go 100% SCV and just add bonds as you near retirement? 

It seems like the Larry Swedrow portfolio basically does this, and Paul Merriman has mentioned it for young investors before as well. 

As for the portfolio allocation, there are a couple of ways to do this. Avantis and Dimensional make suitable funds, and you can just mimic the standard VTI/VXUS split with the corresponding SCV funds or just split it right down the middle and keep it 50/50. 

I know some will feel that this goes against the boglehead mindset, but it is rooted in the same fundamental ideas. Given the reliability of the size and value premiums over the last hundred years or so (in addition to market risk exposure), you are still diversified. Arguably more so than VT. It's also a very simple strategy of buy and hold investing with relatively low costs, reducing risk as you near retirement...

"ONLY LEGAL SUGGESTIONS!!! if the answer is “you can’t legally avoid US taxes” then O.K.

In this hypothetical..

You live and work in U.S., citizenship.

Obviously you pay income taxes on your salary and whatever investments (401k, HYSA interest, HSA, etc).

Let’s take HYSA for example. It’s 5% APY.

Is there a way to enroll as a foreigner in another country’s HYSA plan or similar alike?

So you can get the 5% growth without U.S. state/federal taxes?

Obviously for this to work the country in question has to have 3 things:

1) not comply or share info with the U.S.

2) have NO tax implications OR have that country tax rate lower than US. Preferably a lot lower for the juice to be worth the squeeze.

3) I like the insurance aspect of US - FDIC. I would need something similar for me to store mass amounts of money offshore.

Side preference - I would prefer the funds to be somewhat liquid, as an emergency. That I can withdraw within 30 days or so. My ultimate plan would be to keep funds in there accruing interest indefinitely.

Earlier this week it was 50% S&amp;P 500 index  ETF and 50% short term treasury ETF (paying monthly dividends at a rate based on 1-3 month treasuries, so about 5% annualized return).

With the consensus that rates shouldn’t go much higher, I already moved half the treasury ETF into a broad bond index.

My question is: how precisely is a broad bond index price linked to current Fed rates (versus say 10 yr Treasury rate, or expectations of future Fed fund rates?).

Basically, I’m wondering if I should keep 25% allocated to short term treasury ETF and take the safe 5% return until Fed cuts come, OR should I move that 25% to a broad bond index immediately to get ahead of a 10-20% bump that may come from ‘expectations’ in advance of actual rate cuts?",Timing allocation switch - short term treasury ETF to broad bond ETF,18j0t19,1702648989.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/18j0t19/timing_allocation_switch_short_term_treasury_etf/,

"# Financials

New.Egg Commerce Inc ( $ N E G G ) has substantially-reduced its expenses over the last few years. Revenues, too, are back on the rise: around $2 Billion per annum. Derivatives are positive all across the board, with a rising cash position pushing from $50 Million to $100 Million likely this quarter. It is unknown why the market capitalization is showing as 20% of the current revenue. Price to sales ratio reveals that the stock could be fundamentally discounted.

# Developments

The company is now the *de facto* leader in Artificial Intelligence for e-commerce. Reports since the beginning of 2023 show a legitimate expansion of their machine learning team(s). $N E G G has not only revolutionized the techniques for gaining new customers using internal big-data statistical processing, but they have disrupted the world with their GPT-assisted reviewal process. New.Egg continues to expand itself into an Artificial Intelligence powerhouse, which makes sense considering New.egg sells the very H100 and A100 developer platforms that they use... not to mention the advanced Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) that they allow customers to trade back in.

The company not only accepts and hoards cryptocurrency for \[and after\] each sale, but they participate directly in the crypto industry: selling crypto-mining-ready GPUs, crypto-mining-ready CPU ASICS, and crypto-mining-ready rigs.

The company further participates in electronic sports (esports), selling pro-gaming-ready PCs and gaming stations. Newegg also sponsors pro-gaming organizations, creating an industry synergy now for future sector growth.

The company participates in selling technology of all kinds: from laptops, tablets, and phones for audiences that include students, professionals, and businesses.

On leadership and confidence, the company recently announced a buyback of $10 Million worth of shares, even though the free float was already as low as 19 Million shares still available. Further, and although there is no evidence to suggest that the buyback even started yet, it only took the company three weeks to meet and satisfy Nasdaq's minimum listing requirements. Any downward threat was abated in near-record time.

# Technicals

The stock quickly pushed up to $2.48 last week. This reflects positively on the board, who overcame and dismantled the naysayers of the discounted stock. When compared with the stock's 2021 price range of around $80.00 per share, one can reasonably ask when the stock will retest those recently-obtained levels. Trendlines are visible at $20.00 per share and $90.00 per share right now.

# TLDR

Shown above, New.Egg Stock ( $ N E G G ) is already the *de facto* leader in Artificial Intelligence in e-commerce. Also a leader in the cryptocurrency mining and esports/pro-gaming industries, New.Egg's financials are showing positive derivatives across the board. $2 Billion per annum range of revenues with market capitalization curiously-discounted at just over 20% of current revenues.

"Hey r/investing,

With some recent developments in the defense sector, I think it’s worth taking a closer look at Lockheed Martin (LMT). Here’s why:

1. New Contracts: LMT just bagged a $175M contract for the F-35 Fighter Aircraft, showcasing its ongoing dominance in the aerospace sector. This is on top of a massive $443M contract for the Black Hawk helicopter. These contracts not only boost revenue but also reaffirm Lockheed’s position as a top defense contractor. If this all wasn’t enough, the House and Senate have just approved a $886.3 billion defense policy bill, and Lockheed Martin, being a leading defense contractor, often benefits from increased defense spending.

2. Stable Revenue Stream: Lockheed’s consistent government contracts, especially from the U.S. Department of Defense, provide a stable and predictable revenue stream. In an uncertain economic climate, this stability is gold.

3. Innovation Leader: LMT is at the forefront of defense technology. From advanced fighter jets to cutting-edge missile systems, their focus on R&amp;D means they’re ahead of the curve.

4. Dividend Payouts: Lockheed’s history of paying dividends is attractive. They’ve been known to increase their dividend payouts.

5. Global Security Demand: With rising global security challenges, the demand for defense equipment isn’t going down anytime soon. Lockheed, with its diverse range of defense products, is well-positioned to meet this demand.

6. Economic Resilience: Defense stocks like LMT tend to be more resilient to economic downturns. Defense spending often remains stable or even increases, regardless of the economic climate.

However, it’s not all sunshine and rainbows. There are risks, like dependency on government policies and global political dynamics. But overall, LMT’s recent contract wins and its strong position in the defense sector make it a stock worth considering.

What do you all think? Is LMT a good long-term play, or are there better options out there in the defense sector?

"Gold has reached record highs this year, propelled by geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainties. ING anticipates continued strength in gold prices through 2024, underpinned by safe-haven demand and the evolving outlook for US interest rates. 

According to the Netherlands-based bank's research, the recent surge in gold prices, particularly in the last quarter of 2023, can be attributed to an increased appetite for safe-haven assets amid growing uncertainties. The outbreak of the Israel-Hamas conflict in October pushed gold close to its previous record of $2,075/oz set in 2020. Despite the easing of concerns over a broader Middle East conflict, gold has maintained its strength, supported by a softer US dollar and favorable US Treasury yields. This upward trajectory culminated in a new record high for gold prices in early December.

The key determinant for gold's outlook, according to ING, is the Federal Reserve's policy. The strength of the US dollar and central bank tightening have exerted downward pressure on gold throughout 2023. However, recent data indicating a cooling labor market and inflation, coupled with market expectations of a rate cut in the coming months, could shift this dynamic. 

Other market participants share the same view. 

“Once central banks stop tightening and start easing rates, which could be next year, gold will probably go higher,” says Bruce Liegel, a macro fund manager and author of the research newsletter Global Macro Playbook. “If we have a global recession, it will impact the amount of easing that the central banks will carry out. The more easing, the higher gold can go later next year and into 2025.”

ING's US economist anticipates rate cuts starting in May, totaling 150 basis points in 2024, and an additional 100 basis points in early 2025. This is expected to provide significant support for gold's upward movement.

The outlook for gold's trajectory hinges on the magnitude of the rate cut, contingent on whether there is a hard or soft landing in the economy.

“The future path of gold is probably higher, and it's going to be determined by the degree of the landing,” says Liegel, who writes a monthly global macro report. “If it’s a hard landing, it will go up a lot more because the central banks will need to ease more. A soft landing means that less easing is required.”

While gold demand trends present a mixed picture, ING foresees a resurgence of investor interest in 2024. Despite ongoing outflows from gold-backed ETFs, sentiment turned positive in October, reflected in net-long positioning. This suggests that there is still room for speculators to contribute to net-long positions in the coming year.

Central banks have also continued to be significant players in thegold market increasing their reserves by approximately 800 tonnes over the first three quarters of 2023. This record-setting pace is driven by concerns over geopolitical tensions and shifting strategies on currency reserves. Notable contributors to this surge include China, Poland, Turkey, and India. Central bank demand, along with sustained investor interest, positions gold favorably for continued strength.

ING notes that the continued buying trend from central banks, together with a weak US dollar on the back of US monetary easing, may set the stage for gold to reach new highs in 2024. The bank anticipates prices to average $2,031 per ounce in 2024, with a fourth-quarter average of $2,100 per ounce. Downside risks revolve around US monetary policy and a stronger dollar, while geopolitical instability remains an upside factor for gold markets in the coming year.

With the Fed went [dovish](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/14/stock-markets-markets-soar-on-dovish-fed-.html) yesterday and potentially going for rate cuts next year, I do see a bull case for gold.

"When they say you'll achieve ""average"" performance by investing in a low-cost index fund like VTSAX, VFIAX or FZROX, that means average compared against the results of highly paid Wall Street professionals like portfolio and hedge fund managers.

If we compare index fund performance against what the average investor actually achieves, [investing in a simple, low-cost index

"Occidential Petroleum has recently sharply dropped in price. Background for this is the acquisition of CrownRock, another oil producer in the Permian basin, for $12b. OXY also overtakes the debt of CrownRock for $1.2b.

About $9b is financed via debt, but they also issue lots of new shares, diluting the current sharebase.

The company had already $42b in liabilities vs. $29b in equities, of which $8b is prefered stock. So that's a lot of debt. They have said that they wanted to use their cash flow to reduce their debt in the upcoming years.

Wall street sees the company very skeptical. The shareprice dropped to $55.5, down from $63 at the beginning of the year.

Warren Buffet has been very bullish on this company for the last couple of years, owning now 25% of the whole company. He's been continuously buying throughout 2023, for a share price of $62-63. Even though he did not finance this acquisition specifically, he must have approved of it -- CEO Vicki Hollub flew to Omaha end of November.

Warren Buffet is obviously bullish on America and also on oil. But that amount of debt is scary, and oil is probably not a ""forever""-bet. Right now, he is betting against the market, having paid a hefty premium to the current price. Another possibility is that it's just a current slump, because the market is flooded with new shares.

But either the market or Buffet is wrong. Which should mean that people who are still convinced of Buffet's genius have now a chance to snatch one of his top favorites for a song.

"I'm in the U.S.

I've read many things on websites about the T+2 rule when it comes to trading with unsettled funds, but can someone explain for this particular scenario:

1. I sold shares of a stock yesterday (Monday). The funds are unsettled and I presume the settlement date is then two days later on Wednesday, right?
2. However, today (Tuesday) I used the unsettled funds to repurchase the same stock.

According to every site I've found on the internet, I can sell these shares tomorrow, Wednesday, and I shouldn't incur a free ride penalty.

However, I wanted to see what ChatGPT said about this (out of curiosity, I wouldn't risk a penalty solely based on what it says), and it said I now have to wait until Thursday to sell these shares or it will be a free ride. It said that by repurchasing the shares on Tuesday, this reset the settlement date.

I don't understand this. Why would it reset/add on an additional day? Is this simply ChatGPT being incorrect, as it's sometimes known to be, or did I really just add on an extra day when I repurchased the shares.

Also, additional questions if you can answer, but not as important:

1. Do brokerage accounts normally show this somewhere, an indicator when its safe to sell shares again? I dont see that anywhere in my Schwab account.
2. At what time of day is it ok to sell on the settlement day? As soon as the markets open?

Thank you

edit:  
I appreciate those who seriously tried to answer my question. I don't think anyone is understanding what the actual question is though. See this illustration of T+2:  
[https://www.ally.com/content/ally/en/content-hub/invest/what-are-unsettled-funds/\_jcr\_content/root/main/article/section\_969635282\_co/row/column/image.img.png/1671587208026/unsettled-funds-in-line.png](https://www.ally.com/content/ally/en/content-hub/invest/what-are-unsettled-funds/_jcr_content/root/main/article/section_969635282_co/row/column/image.img.png/1671587208026/unsettled-funds-in-line.png)  


Note: At the bottom of the illustration it says, ""the proceeds from the sale will be in your account DURING the settlement period and MAY BE USED to purchase other securities WITH UNSETTLED FUNDS.""  


That's correct (my brokerage firm told me this in 2006), that's fine, that's what I've been doing for 20 years. However, the question is, if you purchase other securities on Wednesday in that chart (The settlement period, which, again, is perfectly OK to do), how long must you then wait to resell them again? Can you resell them on Thursday (the original settlement day in the chart)? Or does that then push the settlement date forward an additional day and you must wait until Friday to sell?

These charts, this rule of buying with unsettled funds, are all over the internet and it's a very clear rule, not something you have to ask your brokerage account about. So the question I'm asking is a twist on that rule but would also be a very clear rule, most sites online just haven't answered that.

**""Contact your brokerage firm.""**

I should clarify because many are saying ""contact your brokerage."" My brokerage is in the U.S. and I'm in SE Asia. I only added ""I'm in the US"" so people know I'm playing by U.S. SEC rules, that these are U.S. stocks I'm trading, but it's much easier to come on here and ask people then to have to top-up Skype and then stay up until 2am to call my brokerage when they open. It's just a major hassle compared to coming to a sub called ""Investing,"" which I presumed was meant for asking and answering investment questions.

Also easier to simply say ""I'm in the US"" so people don't respond with ""depends on your country's laws."" I didn't anticipate so many people telling me to call my brokerage in a sub meant for helping people with investment questions, so I didn't want to get into this big explanation about where I live and why I haven't called them. This isn't really something that should require a call if people understand what I'm asking.

I'm asking about hard rules on trading that apply to everyone when it comes to trading with unsettled funds, not something personalized to me and my situation and not something specific to my brokerage. It's something you should be able to open a book and see as a hard rule, something that should be posted on most investment sites. It's not a nuanced situation personal to me or my brokerage. It's something most day traders would be familiar with (except those like me who have always just waited until the funds settled as a precaution).

**""Margin account vs non-margin account.""**  
Not relevant. If I'm trying to trade with unsettled funds, that means I'm not trading on margin. Appreciate the effort to help but I don't want this to distract from the question. For those mentioning a margin account, yes, a margin account, for example, would be ideal, but I don't have that so I'm asking what the rules are without a margin account.

Again, appreciate the responses but this is something that's a pretty dry, clear cut rule that would apply to anyone buying with unsettled funds. Something that would be posted on a website for everyone to read as a general rule (and I'm sure it's posted out there somewhere, just can't find it), not something I should have to call my brokerage about. It's not a nuanced situation.

"Just curious about any opinions out there. Here’s mine summarized: 

BTI: - actively shifting focus to non-combustibles, goal of 50% revenue by 2035.
- Very strong financial management with debt reduction and high dividend (9.5%)
- Decreasing demand for cigarettes. 
- Not in S&amp;P500 but currently at a value price.

MO: - Focus on smoke free future with ‘On!’ and ‘NJOY’ products. 
- Leveraging pricing power quite effectively.
- Horrible stewardship but in S&amp;P500
- Dividend (9.2%)

PM: - Aims to be predominantly smoke free by 2025. Lead brands include IQOS and ZYN with good performance.
- Very good strategic pricing approach.
- 3/4th of income is from non US/China consumers. 
- Dividend (5.5%)

OVERALL:
- All 3 focus on alternative products in response to declining cigarette volumes and changing consumer perspectives.
- BTI’s recent performance and aggressive move towards non-combustibles positions them favorably for growth despite recent lagging.
- PM and MO have established strategies in smoke-free offerings with PM edging out everyone.","BTI(British American Tobacco), MO(Altria), or Phillip Morris (PM)",18gpnh0,1702398014.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/18gpnh0/btibritish_american_tobacco_moaltria_or_phillip/,

"Hey guys would appreciate some help. I'm 30 y/o, single, dentist grad in 2022 and grad from residency in July 2023. 

My 2023 gross income will be around $90k (residency + Saturday moonlighting during residency + real job started in August). My yearly income from now should be minimum 180k gross, and in future a lot more as I plan to own my own practice in a couple years.

Other investments: 

-Have 10k in Fidelity 403b thru residency.

-Just added max to Fidelity HSA I just opened.

-30k in Robinhood ETFs. 

So this will be the last year I can likely contribute to a Roth IRA without doing Backdoor. My question is should I put it all in a Roth, Traditional, or a mix? My dad is advising me to do Traditional but I'm fuzzy on the reasoning. Also if I do Traditional now, will it cause issues with trying to do Backdoor in future?

He's also suggesting to open it via Robinhood for 1% match. Whereas I would rather stick with Vanguard or perhaps move everything to Fidelity since I have a couple other things there and prefer the interface. Any thoughts on that as well?

Financials:
- Makes ~$150k base, with highly variable bonuses from $60-200k each year
- No debt whatsoever - fully paid for (inexpensive) house and cars
- Low cost of living, rural area 
- Has $700k in HYSA and CDs, will likely have $800k in profit sharing account upon retirement 

Retirement:
- Will draw total of ~$4k/mo with wife on social security if he waits until 62 (I think) to draw
- Wants to have investment income to supplement their lifestyle, ideally a nest egg 

Investing knowledge:
- Has invested in single stocks for fun before
- Understands HYSA and CDs
- Suspicious of investment vehicles he hasn’t had time to understand (mutual/index funds, bonds, etc)

" Please read before posting.

A mutual fund is pooled investment vehicle with a basket of individual stocks/bonds/whatever.

Within the fund, the fund managers are constantly selling/buying and receiving dividends. The IRS has special rules for mutual funds which allow them to not pay taxes on the capital gains/dividends generated provided they pass through almost all of the proceeds from said activities to the shareholder within the calendar year. So, dividends are often paid on some set schedule but capital gains are generally retained within the fund till the end of the year (because losses can reduce gains but can't be distributed to a shareholder).

So on to why your fund dropped: in mid-December everyone starts distributing these gains and as we know when a fund makes a distribution its NAV drops by an equal amount. For example - a fund that was trading at $10 and had It's value made up of $9 worth of stock and $1 worth of cash to be distributed now no longer has that $1. So it'll drop by 10% because of that fact. Don't worry, you didn't lose any money because the $1 was paid to you in cash (and in most cases reinvested in the form of buying more shares).

There isn't any value created or lost in a distribution (except to taxes) it's just a necessary taxable transaction that must occur because of how mutual funds are structured. ETFs are technically subject to this as well but since most follow passive cap weighted strategies or use the creation/redemption to wash out appreciated shares so they don't usually have capital gains realized to distribute.

Also please feel free to add whatever questions/comments you have to this sticky.

Here's a quick way to see what capital gains estimates/distribution dates are for most funds: [https://mutualfundobserver.com/discuss/discussion/56970/2020-capital-gains-estimates](https://mutualfundobserver.com/discuss/discussion/56970/2020-capital-gains-estimates).

"I’m trying to thoroughly internalize the importance of diversification for investing portfolios and develop a more nuanced understanding for trading off risk and average return.

My understanding starts from two claims:
A) Diversification does not improve average infinite-time return.
B) Diversification helps protect against variance in returns for a limited time horizon. Eg, the scenario of your portfolio being at a low when you need to sell or not growing enough to meet the goal you set for it.

If you know that you won’t need (and importantly, won’t touch) a fund for X years, then the amount of diversification should be higher as X shrinks, right? This is exactly how vanguard’s target date funds work, I think.

Then, some thought experiments:

1) is there any target date for which it wouldn’t make sense to diversify at all? If you were absolutely certain that you could leave money untouched for 200 years (for some odd hypothetical situation), would you design that target date fund to purely maximize average return until 2050, then start diversifying?

2) if you were willing to fully gamble on a portfolio and only wanted to maximize average return, would it make sense to diversify at all? For this hypothetical situation, let’s say it’s an untouchable fund that will go to charity when you die. You can tolerate all risk, can’t pull anything out even if you wanted to, and simply want the biggest expected charitable impact.",Thought Exercises Regarding Risk and Timespans,18el9p6,1702150812.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/18el9p6/thought_exercises_regarding_risk_and_timespans/,
"After working for 15ish years in a full-time job, I decided to make the jump and go freelance two years ago. It’s been great, I’m making more money, and my work-life balance has improved dramatically. I’m now confident that I can do this and make it work, and am excited to grow my business.  

I have the opportunity to purchase some equipment that will increase my income as well, but I am trying to figure out the best way to make it happen. 

The equipment costs ~$130k.  However, each day that I use it, I can charge $2,000 in rental fees. A conservative estimate would be 30 rentals per year, so ~$60k year. It would pay for itself in a little over two years. After that, it’s extra income. I’d estimate it will last about 8 years before becoming obsolete.  If those numbers hold true, it should net a profit of around $350k over the initial investment. 


From my time at my day job, I managed to save ~$200k in a retirement account.

My question is:  Would it make sense to pull that money out of my retirement for the equipment purchase?  I know that touching retirement accounts early is usually a terrible idea - but I also see this as just a different type of investment, and I feel more confident investing in my business than I do leaving it to the whims of the market. 

If I leave it in the market, even with a 10% return, I’m looking at about ~$150k profit in 8 years vs ~$350k from the equipment. 

Also - if I were to pull it out, I know I’d have to pay income tax on it. However, if I immediately use the money to buy the gear, it will be deductible, and net out the added income from cashing out. I know I’d have to pay the early withdrawal penalty, but from my math I still come out on top. 

Financing could be another option - but I would prefer to avoid that with interest rates this high.  And the interest would most likely still be higher than the early withdrawal penalty.

"It appears that some investors have a strong preference for dividend-generating investments like commercial real estate and oil and gas wells. These are typically the domain of private equity investors who evaluate opportunities based on metrics such as NPV, IRR, EBITDA. Conversely, there are the more casual equity investors who often follow the traditional advice of investing in index funds.   
Clearly, these represent two distinct investment philosophies, but where do they intersect?  


Consider these two scenarios with an initial investment of $1,000,000:  


1) Investment in Residential Mortgage Notes  
This involves buying mortgages secured by real property, offering a consistent IRR of 10-15%. Reinvesting dividends in more mortgages could increase the IRR to 25%, accounting for taxes. This option provides flexibility in cash flow and liquidity for individual notes. Over 30 years, reinvesting dividends could lead to a 31% IRR and a business generating $200,000 monthly cash flow.  


2) Investment in VOO  
This option offers no control but requires minimal effort and incurs no taxes until the investment is sold. A 7% Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) would result in $7,600,000 over 30 years.

I mean, for the most part, it’s just gone down. I obsess over this stock, for good reason. I own over 40k shares. I’ve been “burned”. But I just kept chasing and happy to do so. I’m not a bag holder. My average is 21 and there are no other companies on the public markets I’d rather own. Here’s my thesis:

My background is in business. I’ve started, bought, sold and invested in private company’s . Mid size, 50-100 employees. Not entirely relevant to investing in public stocks, but it is to gauging a management team’s effectiveness and intent. 

The CEO, RJ, is an MIT engineer. He is disciplined, effective and focused. He’s also the founder.The CFO, Claire, is impressive also. She just did a 40 minute interview. It’s worth a watch. 

Reasons people say not to buy:

Reasons 1-3: No profit/future dilution/debt

Scale and optimizations will lead to gross profitability in 2024. Net profit is further out. Van is at gross profit already. Announcements for new van contracts will be made after holidays. Who will it be? You are about to start seeing even more Rivians on the road. Maybe net profit in 2025/6. Meaningful profit will come after GA plant is built. BTW, the scale and size of this plant. 

So, in the next couple years how are we going to survive? We’ll have to raise. Why deny it? What an investor should do is look at how previous raises were done and ignore how the stock responded. The GA plant deal with the state of GA was a solid deal for both the State and RIVN. And we get a monstrous, state of the art plant. 🇺🇸🇺🇸

The raise before that, to sustain operations, was executive artistry and the stock was destroyed. No dilution until 2030 at $23 a share and locked in 3% interest. 

I trust management to perform their next raise in a way that protects shareholders. And history gives me no reason to believe other wise. 

Reason 4-6:

Demand/higher interest rates/economy

RJ says plainly demand is not a problem. Can we back up the statement? No paid ads while every other company is buying ad space, even though apparently Amazon is now advertising us for free on Thursday night football. Increased prices while everyone else lowering prices. Increased deliveries from estimated 50 to 54k deliveries. 84k deliveries planned for next year will be gravy. After that, Georgias on our mind and we’ll have more models/more optimizations and more scale leading to more profit. 

Reason 7-&gt;

The stock is shit:

I can’t argue that, that’s why I’ve made money buying puts. It’s not shit anymore.

EDIT: I think I was incorrect in saying 85k next year. 85K doesn’t come until after current plant upgrades have been made so that’s more like middle of 24 to middle of 25 or something. We’ll have more details on that soon and quite honestly in my opinion, it could be a Berish catalyst at this point.",RIVN.

Back during the GME phase, I made some good and not so good decisions. I made some quick money, then made some more. Got cocky and ""Lost"" even more. Currently sitting on this what I now call speculations and not investments, I'm not entirely sure where to move with them. This is the first time I've been in this situation as this is what started my journey.

This may be more well suited for Canadian investing due to the account type but none the less there is a bigger group here for the same advice.

I probably would have dropped the two bigger holdings by now if it wasn't in a TFSA(Tax sheltered), which would result in contribution room loss. My biggest concern is with CLOV and CLNE. I don't really have money to average down( I do but it goes elsewhere), which would be super easy but suffers the same fate as my current situation. As well my investing strategy has since then changed after reading and learning about these mistakes. I'd very much like to average down on both, to slowly recover some of the value and then drop them entirely. CLOV swings quiet a bit from .90-1.25+ and there could be money made that way. In the end I'd like to just hold out and wait for a recovery but with the purchase prices I'm not sure that's an option, so averaging down may be necessary for that to happen.

I'm familiar with Contrafund as I'm invested in it now through my standard brokerage account and have been for about 7-8 years, and am happy with its performance.

For context, I'm 35 years old and am not spooked by market fluctuations - this is a long term hold and as I move closer to retirement, I will diversify into ""safer"" investments that are less adverse to a down market.

When comparing the 2 funds, the ""Hypothetical 10 year growth of $10,000"", as displayed by Fidelity's comparison tool, shows Contrafund outperforming Vanguard 2055 in a way that cannot be ignored - Roughly 30k final fund growth for Contrafund, compared to \~20k final fund growth for Vanguard 2055.

TLDR: If I'm looking for more aggressive growth over the next 10-15 years, would it make sense to invest my 401k funds within my new Rollover IRA account in Fidelity Contrafund instead of continuing with Vanguard 2055 Retirement Fund, and diversify down the road?",Rollover IRA - Continue investing in Target Date 2055 Fund (Vanguard) or purchase a Managed Fund (Fidelity Contrafund),18d5dsw,1701982591.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/18d5dsw/rollover_ira_continue_investing_in_target_date/,

"Hello,

I'm helping my family invest and I'm looking at their fixed income asset allocation. The criteria they asked for was:

* Getting back the money near the end of 2028, for a potential liquidity need they might have in early 2029
* Distributing dividends/interest, because they like getting some dividends to pay for trip expenses
* We are non US. residents or citizens, so investing in bonds or, in the case of funds, UCITs trading in the LSE


Following the Boglehead's advice on their Wikia, and after reading some other threads here, I came upon the concepts of maturity date bond fund UCITs. It would make sense that a distributing maturity date bond fund provides the liquidity my family needs, both yearly as well as at maturity, and reduces the risk of a single company defaulting.

Specifically I saw this one trading in the LSE: https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/331715/ishares-ibonds-dec-2028-term-corp-ucits-etf

Here's some info from the website and the factsheet:

* Weighted Average YTM as of 05/Dec/2023 5.16%
* Weighted Avg Coupon as of 05/Dec/2023 4.25
* Distribution Yield 0.35%
* Quarterly distributions
* TER 0,12%


Where I'm getting confused is this. 

1) There's no Yield to Worst information, right? I'd assume most of the bonds inside the fund are callable.
2) Even though the YTM is 5.16% and the weighted average coupon is 4.25%, this thing is only distributing 0.35% * 4 = 1.4% right? Not anywhere close to the 4% of the average coupon. Where's the extra yield going to?

"Recently, I've been grappling with a profound sense of inadequacy compared to others. The emotional toll is particularly intense because over the years, I've experienced significant losses that seem unparalleled within my friend circle and community. In 2021, I recklessly invested 30k of my life savings in meme stocks and cryptocurrencies, resulting in substantial unrealized losses. Although there's potential for recovery, the hindsight of what could have been achieved by simply investing in index funds weighs heavily on me. Additionally, the legalization of sports gambling in 2022 led me to impulsively squander my paychecks throughout that year.

Thankfully, I halted these destructive patterns in late 2022 and managed to save up 25k. Yet, the nagging thought persists that this sum could have been 100k had I chosen a more prudent investment path. In total, I estimate my cash losses to be in the range of 50-60k. Complicating matters, both my older and younger brothers were entangled in this financial rollercoaster, borrowing money and experiencing losses. While my older brother, now in medical school, promises to repay his debts along with potential gains, the financial aftermath remains a burden.

At 25 years old, with an income of 55k and relatively low expenses around 1500, I've decided against homeownership, preferring the multi-generational living model seen in my home country. This arrangement resonates with me, and I foresee it becoming more prevalent in the United States.

Adding to my current distress is the unfulfilled promise I made to myself at the beginning of the year to invest in Bitcoin. Unfortunately, I hesitated, waiting for a specific price point based on a YouTuber's prediction. The cryptocurrency bottomed at 15.5k instead of the predicted 12k, leaving me with regret. Had I acted, my plan was to hold onto it for a few years, selling at a projected 100k and offsetting the losses from my 2021-2022 mistakes.

If you look at both charts, the Cash App chart for Warner Bros shows a stock price of $87.47 on January 6, 2014.

"trying to understand the principles and tactics involved as I have no experience with options and LEAPS. 

many dividend stocks and CEFs seem to have this nasty little habit of declining stock price over time, plus a decent amount of volatility. But if NAV stays mostly intact, that wouldn't bother me too much.

is there a way to lock in a specific cost on yield by buying options? Especially in a longer term position where the investment hypothesis is that the company will continue to pay some dividend even if they reduce it some during rough times, my total return would be okay even if the payout fluctuates. 

my general understanding is that options and long term options (leaps?) are meant for this purpose: to lock in a cost basis and reduce risk.

"Hey everyone, I have a question regarding generating income to allow myself to contribute to my Roth IRA. For context I’m currently in graduate school and am no longer working. The past two years I’ve worked and been able to max out my Roth contributions while not making enough to be taxed when filing. I currently have ~35000 dollars in a brokerage account. I have made 808 taxable dollars in dividends and that is my only income for the year. I would like to try and contribute more than that. So I was wondering if it is possible (legal?) to sell all of my current long term investments that are positive then reinvest them. If I did this I would net ~5200 as income bumping me up to around 6000 to contribute to my Roth. Am I allowed to just sell my current gains and repurchase their positions, or does that form a sort of wash for tax purposes? If not could I potentially pivot to different holdings? If that is possible is there any other way I could generate the extra 500$ dollars of apparent income to max my contribution? Thanks in advance.

"As an example, Moody's downgraded China this morning. I won't speculate on what this means for individual stocks, but perhaps a good case to consider for arguments sake.

News such as this will have 1st order impacts (e.g. companies holding Chinese sovereign bonds will see a fall in their asset values, all else being equal). However, if I'm not mistaken, firms will not publish detailed and up-to-date ledgers of their holdings - so how is the market so quick to quantify these first-order impacts on the values of individual companies?

Second order impacts might be that lesser security in Chinese markets leads to greater demand for, say, US assets and helps to boost US markets. I imagine these second order impacts are even more difficult to quantify.

There will also be third, fourth, fifth (etc) order impacts which will become increasingly difficult to quantify.

"Hey everyone!

I'm reaching out to the investing community with a focus on understanding how traditional investors are perceiving the integration of blockchain technology into their investment activities. 

As we know, blockchain has been a game-changer in various sectors, and its influence is increasingly being felt in the investment world. One of the key developments I've observed is how blockchain is reducing barriers to investing compared to traditional markets (e.g. improved accessibility, enhanced transparency, instant finality, etc.) As blockchain technology matures, we're witnessing the emergence of new applications that bridge traditional investing with the blockchain world. A prime example of this is the tokenized real-world assets protocols. These protocols are revolutionizing how we approach traditional assets like stocks, commodities, and bonds by bringing them on-chain.

* Is the shift towards blockchain and tokenization something that excites the majority of traditional investors? 
* Have you encountered the realm of tokenized real-world assets in your investment journey?We're seeing large institutions like Blackrock showing interest in asset tokenization. What do you think drives this push, and are you aware of the benefits they see in this move?

"I've seen so many posts saying Nvidia, the sky is still the limit. But I just want to call this out: the US government has thrown down the gauntlet with them. Basically the government said, don't try and tweak the chips to get around the restrictions on china. The statement basically said that the government will classify the chips as restricted as quickly as Nvidia can develop them.

20-25% of Nvidia revenue comes from china. This won't wipe all of that out, but it will eat into it. This makes it even harder for Nvidia to achieve record growth.

Oh, and make no mistake: with the P/E as high as it is, it's not enough for Nvidia to do well: it has to do EXTREMELY well to justify it's valuation. IMO, the downside risk in the short term is far higher than the upside risk.

That is the risk with chasing market leaders, as so many people do.

"I am very curious to know what other's thoughts are holding $$ in a HYSA versus an ETF that tracks the returns of treasury bonds.

I currently hold $X in a HYSA. I need this $$ to 1) face zero risk and 2) be accessible without penalty within a few days. 

Right now, the best return I can get through my financial institutions while meeting these conditions is a 5% yield. A quick google search showed me that I can get as high as a 5.4% APY (Popular Direct), with others close by (5.35% My Banking Direct, for example).

I am considering moving this money to an ETF like SGOV. SGOV also offers zero risk, and right now it pays a monthly dividend equivalent to a 5.23% yield. This is slightly more than I am getting right now in my HYSA and slightly less than the best available (according to my google search). 

I looked back over the past three years to compare the strategies. (I didn't do a formal backtest, just looking at charts online.)  What I noticed is that SGOV seemed to track closely with the fed funds rate and also the rates for my HYSA. I also noticed that before June 2022, when the fed funds rate hadnt skyrocketed yet, the yield for the long term bond funds (for examples TLT) exceeded that of SGOV and other short term funds, as well as the rates for any HYSA. 

So for instance, during the period of June 2020-June 2023, if I had held $X in TLT from June 2020 to June 2022, and then shifted it to SGOV in June 2023, I would have gotten a better return than possible with any HYSA.

What do y'all think? Besides having to actively manage between short-term and long-term bond funds, is there any drawback to a bond funds ETF strategy like I describe above?",HYSA or Treasury Bond funds,18b0e34,1701740252.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/18b0e34/hysa_or_treasury_bond_funds/,

"I'm in a situation that surely is not uncommon, and wondering what others' thoughts are and how y'all usually handle this.

I have several stocks that for me have been clear losers, dropping to \~5-10% of cost basis. (In many cases 'cos I had the misfortune of getting into the market in a big way in Jan 2021 when a lot of tech stocks were at a peak... but that's largely besides the point.)

Examples if anyone is curious: &gt;!LMND, OUST, FVRR, CHPT!&lt;

At this point, my holdings in them are in most cases worth only a few tens or couple hundreds of dollars (I generally put on the order of $1-2k into any given stock to start with), and even for those which now have positive outlooks and which have been making significant positive moves, realistically that's only gonna reduce my losses on them from like 90% to 80%.

In this sort of situation, is it worth holding on to them at all?

On the one hand, the potential for *further* loss at this point is small, while there's maybe still some potential for upside (albeit probably also small).

On the other hand, further loss is still loss, and offloading them would give me a couple fewer things to keep track of.

So, what would you do in this sort of scenario?

"I am determined not to repeat the financial mistakes I made in my early 20s, specifically during the years 2020, 2021, and 2022. In that period, I squandered all my life savings and every paycheck on speculative investments such as meme stocks, penny stocks, and sports gambling, resulting in a significant loss of around $50,000. Fortunately, at 25 years old, I recognize the importance of learning from this experience now rather than facing similar setbacks in my late 30s or 40s.

As of the end of this month, I anticipate having $40,000 saved. Reflecting on missed opportunities, I regret not investing $15,000 in Bitcoin at the beginning of 2023, especially considering the current price. While I acknowledge this as a 'what if' scenario, I had set my purchase target at $10,000, realizing the mistake in hindsight.

To avoid repeating past errors, I am seeking advice on prudent and secure investment options for my $40,000. One consideration is maxing out my IRA, but as I haven't contributed to one before, I am uncertain about the process. With an annual income of $55,000 and monthly expenses of approximately $1,500, I am debt-free. If I choose to maximize my IRA, would investing in index funds like Vanguard or the S&amp;P 500 be a wise decision?

Additionally, I am contemplating allocating $10,000 to cryptocurrency, particularly Chainlink, based on the recommendation of a friend who has been accurate about Bitcoin and Ethereum predictions. Despite the potential for substantial gains, I am apprehensive about the risk of a market crash, given my history of unfortunate stock investments.

"I hope this is subreddit is an appropriate place to ask this. Tried r/IRA and r/RothIRA, but those both seem to be inactive.

Because of my and my wife's income, I thought I was ineligible to contribute to a Roth IRA. Somewhat embarrassingly, at age 42 I just learned about back door Roth IRAs in the last week. After a little more research, I'm planning on opening the accounts this week, but had a question about funding the Roth.  
  
Plan to max out my contribution for 2023 in one lump sum, but moving forward I was thinking about shifting a portion of the automatic deposits I have going to my brokerage account and have those deposited in the traditional IRA account automatically instead, and have the annual limit maxed out by the end of each year. I think I would then need to manually have them moved to the Roth account.  
  
A couple things I've read and watched said this was a bad idea, and I'm trying to make sure I understand why. Obviously, one negative would be that it's better to have all of the money there as early as possible to maximize growth. The other thing I've read is that it is just more work to ""trickle"" fund it instead of a lump sum.  
  
Anything else I'm missing that would explain why this would be a bad strategy? One thing I want to make sure of is that I don't have to fill out multiple 8606 tax forms for each of the smaller transfers, but I would assume one form would suffice for all deposits for that tax year.

Hi Guys, I'm an 18-year-old, holding dual citizenship in Germany &amp; the US, and currently live in Australia on a visa.   
I recently got access to a relatively large sum of money which I want to invest in a Multi-asset ETF like AOA. I was looking into turning this into a Roth IRA to begin contributing to my retirement and of course get tax-advantages.   
After some research, I've concluded that I don't yet qualify for a Roth IRA (as I don't earn enough and haven't paid enough taxes to the IRS), and due to the limited nature of my Visa the superannuation funds' Departing Australia superannuation payment (DASP)'s high tax rate of 35-45% I would literally lose money if invested it into my super.

"How exactly does offsetting an options contract work , for example if we're to go long on a call or put position in order to offset it i would need to short a call or put position, this eventually makes my returns net 0 and im assuming the exchange knows this fact so if you were to ever go through these motions of offsetting i described above , the exchange considers it an offset rather than two separate unrelated transactions being carried out right?  
  
However if i was to say short a call position and someone buys this off me , and i then close my position before expiry ,im out of the transaction ,but then what happens to the person i sold the call position ,what happens to the person i bought the call position from ,are they paired up ? The other question i had was i read on investopedia that when offsetting ,it doesnt matter what securities that are being used in the contract as long as they all have the same issuer, strike, and maturity features.How is this possible though,like if im shorting a call option and then want to offset it ,i cant write another call option and then buy that to offset my original short position , it just doesnt make sense ,and on top of that surely what securities you use matter when you are offsetting ,as in it has to be the same type and amount of shares ,cant just be in any shares. investopedia link :https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/offsetting-transaction.asp its under the headline Understanding Offsetting Transactions  
  
 Furthermore when i wrote this short contract can i sell my position to someone else ?as in selling the position of delivering the underlying stock to whoever bought my call or put(is their a term for this) , in a similar way when someone buys a call or put they can sell their position to someone else (or offset it ).

"Here are 2 charts of US Bond fund FXNAX and Fed interest rates from Dec 2018 to Dec 2023  


[FXNAX vs Fed interest rate](https://imgur.com/a/zuR9d3Z)  
from the charts you can see  
1 - The bond fund peaked when Fed rate dropped near 0  
2 - The bond fund continue its decline until Oct 2023  
Looks like it's directly correlated to the anticipation of rate hike - 1. It peaked around Apr 2020 as Fed had no room to further cut rate - it's near zero. 2. around Oct 2023, FXNAX finally stopped the dropping and moving up - as more and more data indicates inflation is under control and further rate hike anticipation dissipated.  
I have been DCA into FXNAX since beginning of the year and I want to accelerate the process in next couple of months, not sure if this is 'timing the market' but I don't think Feds are going to significantly raise the rate.

"Edit: Title should read ""plan **sponsors**"" not ""plan administrators""

We all know that 401(k)s/403(b)s typically have fewer options to invest in compared to IRAs and traditional brokerage accounts (unless the 401(k)/403(b) allows a ""self-directed brokerage account"" option that typically costs the investor high fees.)

Similar to how employer-sponsored health insurance is cheaper than individual health insurance. Obviously, that reasoning is wrong.

"I hope this post is appropriate as I’m currently trying to figure out my investment finances. I did search the sub for this ticker but almost everything that could be valuable is about seven years old and I don’t know if that information is still relevant.

I’ve recently been put into an unexpected financial position that doesn’t allow me to contribute much to my retirement account anymore. I’ve been putting money into sgenx for my Roth for close to ten years now on the advice of my previous employer’s financial guy. Over the past five I’ve noticed that it just wasn’t accumulating as much as I’d thought it would based on initial expectations, and I unfortunately don’t have the original paperwork on the outlook. I didn’t look into it much and assumed it would get better based on time. Time in the market, right? If I could retire at 60 or 65 like I’d planned, I doubt I’d have any questions, but since I’m essentially retired ten years earlier than expected I’ve had to do a deep dive on my financial outlook.

I’ve been looking around various sites to get more information on this fund, and Seeking Alpha has it underperforming the S&amp;P 500 by a significant margin. I’d thought the rate of return would be at least that, but it seems like I could have just put the money into a savings account and have the same return. I did find a post here from four years ago that talked about how to separate your contributions versus what was earned and I plan on doing that tomorrow, if I can based on the limited data offered on my account, but can anyone offer an opinion on this? I’m not sure if comparing this to the S&amp;P is appropriate, for starters. I’ve also talked to more than one advisor since my finances changed, and have basically got a “good luck with a HYSA” answer. Which I’m fine with if that’s the only alternative, but I’m not convinced it is. I’m not interested in heavy speculation, of course, but something to give me a little more hope.

"Question on covered call and taxes.

Hi all, US Tax Question. Would love some feedback. 

Let's assume I wrote ATM call option on a stock which I owned for more than a year, and just before expiration the option is deep in the money. 

Isn't it always better to buy back the option before expiry than letting it be assigned?

From a tax perspective, if I buy back the option I will record a tax loss on the option which will be around the difference between the underlying price and the strike. 

This loss will provide a short term tax shield. 
I can then sell the stock at current price, which will generate a long term capital gain. 

This seems better than holding to maturity, which would mean that the premium received when the option was sold would be taxed as short term gains and there will be smaller long term capital gain on the assigned asset.

- The new survey results underscore a sweeping shift in the investment practices of family offices, the private investing arms of families with assets typically of $100 million or more.

- Along with private markets, family offices are also showing increasing interest in alternative assets, including real estate and commodities.

The rationale is that if interest rates go down in US the USD will loose against EU but I would recover this from the increase of the fund. Viceversa, if they go up I would recover the loss of the bond with the more favorable exchange. Does this make sense?

"Hi everyone,

I am looking to start a career in Financial planning and was looking at Model Portfolios (came across this in my CFI course). 

My first question is, do firms (like Blackrock) that provide model portfolios provide asset allocation and the basket of securities that go into the portfolio, and I as the FP would have to buy those securities for my client? or would I give them the funds and they would manage it on my behalf.

If I am managing it, what happens if there is a change in portfolio allocation? Do I get updated and have to make the changes manually?

My second questions is: A firm that I am looking to work for in the future says that they will give FPs access to external 'Managers' and 'Mandates'. can you tell me the difference in what those two are?

"Please forgive me for making another one of these posts but I tried researching this subreddit and got even more confused. 

Started my first “big boy” job recently and was offered a 401k match. I haven’t thought much about retirement until now, and at 25+ I’m way behind the curve. 

I making sub 60k in salary. Single male, with hopes of buying a house within 4 years *fingers crossed* I’m banking on the fact that I’m in a industry that can double my salary in that time span (If I work smart and get lucky). I want to ideally retire at 55 (slightly delusional) and live in another country in retirement. 

Ok on to the problem at hand. I did some basic research before coming here and was pretty sold on the idea of a Roth 401k. Give Uncle Sam his money now, and pay no tax in retirement. But then I came across some posts in this subreddit and saw opinions of getting a tax break now and paying it in retirement because you may be in a lower tax bracket then than you would be now while working. Solid point. Someone also pointed out the fact that I could die before retirement and not had paid any taxes lol which is a great point as well. 

Anyway, I say all that to say, I’m a very confused individual at the minute and looking for some solid advice from anyone willing to share. 

Roth or Traditional? Both? 

What do I even invest that in? Stick with a Target Date Fund until I get a better understanding of other options? I assume I can change my investment plans in the future. And if I go with Target Date fund, I assume I’ll have to set it when I turn 60 given I wont get access to it until 59.5? 

Again, I know you all see these posts quite often. I tried reading some of them before making this post but I didn’t see much that clearly answered my questions given the situation I am in. So I would definitely appreciate any helpful advice. 

Hopefully I don’t have to make another one of these post when I start investing on my own.","Another “What Should I Do? Post, So Sorry",187n8yj,1701363383.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/187n8yj/another_what_should_i_do_post_so_sorry/,

His wealth of knowledge and common sense was greater and exceeded the utility of that which most tertiary institutions teach us these days, consistent with his criticism of modern day universities run by idiots.

"Real quick, the quote marks on ""shorting"" is because I'm not borrowing anyone else's shares, so it's not a short by any stretch. 

Recently I've taken to selling chunks of my holdings whenever I see a pretty big increase weekly or daily (usually 3% or more), and increasing my holdings when I see a similar large downturn, especially with stocks I'm intending to go long on. I find that regardless of whether I profit from the arrangement or not in the short term, I do walk away with more shares in my in investment than I had before with the same initial investment, which in the long term seems to me like a worthwhile little optimization to make, especially when it comes to shares that pay dividends. I can often scoop up an extra fifth of a share at a time in the process. Even if the share continues to increase after I sell it, I find this fine given that I still have a considerable amount held in it, so in the event it won't make it down to a lower price for me to scoop up extra fractionals, I can just put it towards other investments instead. 

This seems to piss off both of my sets of investor friends, whether long term or short term. My short term minded friends hate it because it cuts into short term profits by selling off stock that is currently increasing, and my long term minded friends hate it because of it how it tries to time the market, and I should just let the shares collect their dividends instead.

I can't tell if either of them have a leg to stand on here. I find my short term minded friends easy to dismiss, but I'm not so sure about my long term minded friends.

$1000 in 4.9% APY = $49 when you must pay back $1000. This essentially means your membership is $11 until rates lower back down

If IRA contribution limit is $7000 next year, this means they will match you $210 of TAX ADVANTAGED money. Having this compound over the years will be huge. (if your time horizon allows.

In conclusion, is this a good idea? or should I stick to fidelity? I won’t roll over my current IRA. I just was thinking I would put $7,000 in for at least 5 years or until/if they get rid of the 3% match.

I have a significant time horizon, so I have focused on pretty aggressive investing, being largely in VGT, VOO, and DIA. 

I was thinking of adding some international diversification to reduce US specific downside risk. However, looking at the options, I can’t seem to find an international ETF that doesn’t significantly and consistently underperform the US market.

It appears to me that international ETFs like VXUS vastly underperform US targeted ETFs like VOO over the course of years/decades. All while having correlated performance, meaning it’s not even a hedge.

"I've been experimenting with different ways to visualize market data and stumbled across something pretty unique. Instead of the usual heatmaps or line charts, I've started using a bubble-based interface.  
Here’s why I’m kinda sold on it: bubbles offer a really fluid and dynamic way to see the market at a glance. Green bubbles growing? Things are looking up. Red bubbles expanding? Maybe it’s time to re-evaluate some positions. It’s like a visual shorthand for market performance that’s surprisingly informative.  
I find that bubbles can convey volume and price change simultaneously, which is something heatmaps or charts don’t always do well in a single view. And when you click on one, it expands to give more detailed info without losing the overall picture—neat for getting both the forest and the trees without switching tabs or screens.  
I’m not saying it’s the holy grail of market analysis, but it’s been a refreshing change from rows of numbers and static images. Plus, it’s pretty satisfying to watch your portfolio bubble up (pun intended).

"Hello - 

I am new to this forum, so I hope I am phrasing my inquiry appropriately. I understand that this isn't the place for personal finance advice, so please feel free to answer more generally.

I am about to inherit a significant sum, and plan to invest it in boring index funds (either an S&amp;P index fund or VUG), and just leave it there until I retire in 20 or 25 years.

From my reading on the topic, I understand that it is basically impossible for laymen like me to time the market correctly.

So what I'm thinking is the following. Throw the funds into 3 or 6 month CD's (currently 5%+ APR), invest 10 percent or so of the total when the CD's mature, and then roll the rest of it over. Repeat for 5 or 6 years until it's all in the market.

The CD would provide a small return, while reducing risk that I am accidentally investing at a market high.

Is this market timing problem enough of a worry to bother with such an elaborate process? 

Or is missing out on 4-5 years of growth for those later investments a bigger risk?

"Hello Everyone. I would love your opinion on this dilemma I am having and how to think about it. 

I am 29 years ears old and make $475,000 a year. I bought a $700,000 home 6 months ago and so far I paid 40% of it off. 

My dilemma is that I have been indecisive about allocating the money either between paying off the house or investing in the S&amp;P500. 

Currently, I allocate all my investment money, minus the 401K, into paying off the house. I will have it paid off in 1.5 years from now if I continue to do that. My reasoning behind being aggressive with paying it down is that I don’t want to pay too much interest, my loan of $425,000 is at 5.5% interest.

Since I allocate most of my investment money into the house to get away from too much interest, I am also missing out on the potential gain from investing aggressively into the S&amp;P500. It’s up like 20% this year. I was thinking to divide the payments 50% in the house + 50% in the S&amp;P but the idea that I can pay less interest slower if I do that hurts my head. On the other hand since I’m paying almost 100% of my investment money into the house it’s making me miss out on the S&amp;P 500 gains. 

How should so approach this?

I max out my 401K every year and so far I have close to $150,000. 

Here are a summary of the stats:
-Age: 29 
-Gross Yearly Income: $475,000 
-Net Monthly Income: $23,750 
-401K Value So Far: $150,000
-Student Loans Debt: $100,000 (Paying Off Slowly) 
-Mortgage Loan Remaining: $385,000 
-Mortgage Monthly Payment: $2415 (Includes P+I)

"I want to buy more WeWork stock. However, I cannot since they're late to file their 10-Q. I'd like to push my cost basis down to $2.50 so I can start getting out above $5.

When I called up Fidelity the guy put me on hold and came back to tell me I cannot buy the stock. Despite, retail being frozen out of the market the price is higher than expected. I have a feeling people with access to the Expert Market know something, and they're defending a price floor. 

The short thesis might be right. However, the trade is crowded and their time frame is wrong. Even with the collapse of Luna / UST the shorts were largely liquidated before price went to zero.

"Since ETFs are easy to buy and have super low fees, they are an attractive option for people.  If I have $1000 and want to easy access to cheap, diversified stocks, I can buy any number of S&amp;P500 or total market ETFs in a couple clicks.  I'll use ticker SPY for this example.

If enough people do this, if would seem like the price could be driven up, beyond (and eventually, far beyond) the price of the underlying assets.  I spendy $1000 today, and looking at the info page on my broker, I am roughly entitled to $70 of Apple, $65 of Amazon, on down the line until I have $0.002 of some other company, all totalling $1000.  Someone else comes along and buys SPY, buy since I've bought the shares I did, they end spending $1000.45 on the next available shares.

If a few million people do this, and people aren't willing to sell SPY at the same price, theoretically, you could see the lowest shares available going up, say to $1200 for the same assets... despite the underlying shares only having moved a little.

At some point, I'd think it could be a problem.  Even if people are just overpaying a few percent.

Essentially when you are a member of a broker, their search engine is usually pretty crap - i.e. normally you would use the internet to find the perfect financial product first (whether that's a stock, a fund or an ETF) and then go to your broker's site to actually buy it.

"Suppose you are holding a casino token with a redemption value of $100. You don't feel like going to the casino to redeem it, so you offer it to your friend - for $1,000. At such an offer, the friend laughs and responds: ""good joke"". He continues, ""I offer you $80 because I have the cost of going to the casino, and after the casino redeems it, I will earn a couple of bucks"". But now let's assume that you hold a digital token - Bitcoin. It has no redemption value because its issuer Satoshi Nakamoto does not redeem it. However, you ask $35,000 for it. Instead of telling you ""good joke"", your friend gives you that amount without a question.

Although in some normal times the scenario from the second example would be like a story from another dimension, we live in times where that scenario is realistic. People today pay enormous amounts of money for non-redeemable digital tokens called cryptocurrencies. There is a mania of mass buying and pumping up the prices of something that is completely worthless.

In history, a similar example of market mania was tulip one. But it was not so extreme because tulips have at least small intrinsic value. At the height of that mania, people paid for them in the equivalent of houses. With cryptocurrencies, like that Bitcoin, people are currently paying the equivalent of new cars for one crypto unit, even though that unit has neither intrinsic nor redemption value. Thus, cryptocurrency purchases are completely irrational. They are the unprecedented example of the Greater Fool theory - people buy something completely worthless in the hope that tomorrow they will sell it to a ""greater fool"".

To rationalize such irrational purchases, people have come up with all kinds of theories. The most frequently repeated is the one that goes like this: ""the value of a cryptocurrency is what people agree on."" According to this theory, that casino token with a redemption value of $100 would be ""worth"" $1,000 if your friend took the joke seriously and paid you $1,000. If he paid $10,000, that would be the ""value"" of the token. Such a theory is clearly flawed. The value of the token is not in the agreement between you and your friend, but in the simple fact that its issuer redeems it for $100. Whatever price you agree on, its value will remain the same.

The next frequently used theory goes like this: ""fiat as well"". According to that theory, crypto currencies are similar to fiat currencies. That is, the units in your crypto wallet are just like the units in your bank account or on your banknote. Not only that, but they are ""better"". Because the second are managed by selfish and evil banks, while the first by a decentralized network of computers. That theory is flawed as well. Namely, unlike crypto units, fiat units have a redemption value. For example, if your friend has a bank loan, and the bank has a lien on his house, the bank will redeem fiat units for reducing his debt and ultimately releasing the lien. Given the fact that fiat units are issued as debt - loan one in the case of companies and individuals and bond one in the case of the governments, their issuers - commercial and central banks, redeem them for reducing or closing that debt and releasing liens on movable and immovable property.

On the other hand, crypto units are not issued as debt. Rather, as numbers. First, a crypto author imagines a number - 21 million in the case of Bitcoin. Then he writes a protocol for assigning units and subunits of that number to online addresses. And that's it. There is no redemption of the units by that author, which would give them some redemption value. The units are just put on the market and go from one buyer to another on the principles of the Greater Fool theory.

So what crypto authors are doing is like when children are playing bank by writing numbers on pieces of paper and use that as ""money"", as ""monetary units"". Cryptocurrencies are the digital version of such child's play. Crypto authors are playing bank by simulating bank deposits with crypto units. People have taken the game seriously and are maniacally buying the units, pumping prices to the sky. It is the example of the Greater Fool theory in an extreme that has never been seen in human history.

"This is a follow-up post to [last year's Bayer AG due diligence](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/zpc7vd/bayer_ag_bayry_due_diligence/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). I mostly discussed how disastrous the Monsanto acquisition was.

To sum it up 2023 was a shit year for Bayer on the stock market with lots of headwinds. There was some good news, but it couldn't compensate. But first, the data (this time in a table):

&amp;#x200B;

|Year|Market Cap (B EUR, approx)|Sales (M EUR)|Net Debt (M EUR)|Free Cash FLow (M EUR)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2018|64|36742|35679|4652|
|2019|69|43545|34068|4214|
|2020|47|41400|30045|1343|
|2021|44|44081|33137|1415|
|2022|54|50739|31809|3111|
|2023|32|49000\*|38721 (Q3)|0\*|

\*=Forecast

In this table we can see why 2023 was not a good year. Debt rose, on the backdrop of higher interest rates. To be fair the Q3/2022 Debt was 36B. Free cash flow is forecast to be 0, which for a company with 50ish Billion Dollars in annual sales is a terrible outcome - and the reason why I reduced my position in BAYRY this summer.

Market cap gradually decreased in 2023 until taking a big hit in November when a pivotal study involving potential blockbuster Asundexian got the axe. Legal woes are ongoing with no end in sight, with anyone and their dog still suing now ""foreign"" Monsanto and juries wielding big sticks when assigning punitive damages. There are also shared headwinds for the pharmaceutical sector overall, with rich countries seeking to cut medical spending post-pandemic.

The good news? Approval for glyphosate was renewed for 10y in the EU, R&amp;D spending is healthy, and the company is led by someone who is not tied to the disastrous Monsanto acquisition from 2018. The latter point is probably the most relevant for investors. Bill Anderson represents a much overdue change in leadership. He is aiming to streamline management and is willing to break up the company for value. In light of recent events the necessity for action should be clear and Bill is likely to get the ball rolling.

In summary: BAYRY is a riskier stock than it was 1 year ago.

"Hi there, I'm somewhat new to personal investing, so I just picked a broker (Morgan Stanley E*Trade). I've used it for a month and I'd say it's ... Okay.

I recently mentioned it to some younger friends of mine, and they're really interested in investing for the first time. Their employers do not offer 401k. The problem is, I can't really recommend E*Trade to them for a few reasons (several of which may make me switch myself). Basically, it's an issue of liquidity. 

Here are some of the concerns:

* Fractional Share Trading: This limits us to **Fidelity**, **Interactive Brokers**, and a few others. Probably my biggest gripe with E*Trade.
* Easy Cash: What are they supposed to do if it's Sunday and they need a $5000 for an emergency that can't be paid via credit card? I presume since it's outside of extended hours, no broker will let you sell, but are there any that will credit you early? And let you withdraw from an ATM and/or instantly move it to a checking account? What do you all do in such a situation? Is there no one that has both checking accounts and fractional share trading? Also, they have to pay their landlords with a check each month.

"Historically we are now at the end of the market cycle as the rate hike period is ending and now it's as I see it, a wait and see game. Inflation is now +/- 1% from the target, and I'm not sure how much more the Fed will do anything.

Historically speaking we now wait for something to break. The job is done, but no damage happened yet. Unless the damage was 2022? The thing is every bear on Twitter/X denies 2022 was a rscession. Even though we had 2 quarters of negative GDP, and a 30% correction with Bitcoin dropping 80% and the ""Magnificent 7"" being hit 40-60%

The Magnificent 7 had a great recovery even with rate hikes, which makes sense as they have money while small caps do not - but the fact we are nearing all time highs in the S&amp;P 500 makes one wonder if this is too good to be true since rates are still over 5%, the yield curve has been inverted what seems like forever, and the political banter behind policy - which is kind of silly as both parties got us in the mess in terms of National Debt.

All this is my analysis. I'm going YOLO short TQQQ in January.

I'm thinking we have a crash in January 2024 - it may be a mirror of 2022 with a 30% crash retesting the 3480 zone. And in fact, it may have nothing to do with Fed decisions as it may be more ""futures"" driven. Everyone expects rate cuts at the end of a market cycle, and if the Fed does not give the market what the market wants, the market will do the work for them forcing them to cut rates to remain solvant. If the larger bond market rates fall but Fed rates remain high, Fed has to lower rates to stay competitive.

 If the S&amp;P 500 breaks 2022 lows, I think it could fall to 2018 levels which would act as support from the last market cycle end / pivot.","Is ""this time different?""

Their position is that no broker should have been ok’ing long positions in GME for ‘retail’ people. I find this super confusing because how much scrutiny do brokers apply to self-directed trades.  Even in the 90s i made a couple of (in hindsight) unsuitable self-directed trades.

"So, speculation is going on on Twitter about WeWork possibly being bailed out. So, people have been buying WeWork since the price action and short interest make it look like the stock could squeeze in the short term. 

From their recent filings it looks like the bankruptcy fillings were most likely more of a strategic move to discharge some debt, and drop landlords. So, shareholders are talking about suing to keep their shares. There was a filing in the bankruptcy filing about SoftBank getting to keep their shares, while everyone else holding the same type of share has their shares declared worthless.  


So, from the shareholder lawsuit, and rumors over a bailout there's a potential squeeze. The short interest is also really high currently. But, that won't happen if retail investors cannot buy shares. At least, not to the AMC / GME level. If a short squeeze does happen there's also the potential for SoftBank to pull WeWork out of bankruptcy by selling some shares. They were within a quarter or two of being break even, prior to the filing. 

Currently, I'm only allowed to sell my shares. I would like to buy more to lower my cost basis, and increase my odds of getting out at break even on a pump, or earn more from a squeeze. So, how do I get expert status? Do I have to be an accredited investor? What type of account do I need for that?

"I’ve had a taxable liquidity event which will have some taxable impact next year and perhaps in subsequent years.  
  
I’ve been looking into an SMA strategy managed by a well known hedge fund that is a version of direct indexing, in short:

* It tracks an index like S&amp;P 500 or Russell 3000, by taking long and short positions in stocks with similar beta
* Plus adds some leverage (about 150 long/ 50 short, or 235, 135) on both long and short side of the trades  
* They say this will generate a good % of realized losses compared to my principal in the short term and unrealized gains that can be realized down the road at a lower cap gains rate ( or maybe I'll die and my heirs will get a step up in basis). 

The question I have is how to properly assess the downside risk. The firm claims that the lower leverage strategy tracks the index within 1.5% tracking error and the higher leverage within 6% tracking error (against the index) but before pulling the trigger I wish someone could help me understand the possible magnitude and likelihood of a more catastrophic negative event with a strategy like this. For example, is there any possibility of losing significantly more than the 12% worse than the performance of the index (tracking error of 6% would claim that 95% of events fall within +/- 12% of the index, but how bad could the other 5% get here?

"Having a reflective day, mostly thinking about hindsight and ""what-ifs"".  Where did approaches like Dogs of the Dow and DOW5 come from?  Are these a thing because they pre-date Index funds and ETFs that mimic index or DOGs/DOW5 approach?

A few years ago I had a divorce settlement to invest.  80% was divided over 4 funds (VOO, MOAT, VYM, HYG) -- mostly smart move.   Since, the HYG as been sold and rolled into a variety of small positions in  O, RA, CAT, CAG, KHC, and C -- ouch. 20% was invested in stocks generally following DOW5 approach -- not so good; DOW, PFE, VZ, and subsequent investment in WBA (follows the approach still) are killing me.

Yes, hindsight clearly shows I should have put it all in MOAT, or the true index VOO would have been ""just fine"" too.  I'm flogging myself enough for not putting all these eggs in that basket; please don't pile on too much.

What is different now with companies and/or the market that makes DOW5 or Dogs of the Dow underperform so badly, when historically they were reasonable approaches for a retail investor?

"Backstory:

In 2015 I bought 10,000 shares @ USD 2 per share for a total investment of USD 20,000 in a private US company in a growth manufacturing industry.

Since then, the company has been heads down on innovating their product and is still pre revenue to this date. That being said, according to the latest investor update they sent out they claim to have a potential sales pipeline north of $500MM.

Over the years the company has gone through a few structural changes the most important being:

1. Two stock splits bringing my total number of shares to 40,000.

2. Restructured to a Canadian company. All shares were converted to the new Canadian entity. Fwiw, I am a Canadian resident.

3. They acquired a European company in the same industry that will significantly expand the company’s technological and manufacturing capabilities. 

Current day:

The company is at a stage now where they want to go public. They initially wanted to IPO in 2021-2022 but market conditions were not ideal for this. However, now they secured a deal with an investment bank to raise north of $20MM in private equity and then want go public through a reverse take over of a clean shell company. They are also offering a final non-brokered placement of CAD 2MM @ CAD 2 per share.

My questions:

1. This was my first foray into investing so I don’t know how common these events are. Are they? Is there something fishy here that I’m not seeing? 

2. Let’s say an RTO takes place. What would the price per share be? Would this be the price of the share of the company being acquired?

3. They are floating this as a liquidity event. Is it? If the acquired company is publicly listed then it means in theory I could sell my shares at market value, right?

4. Since they are offering shares at CAD 2 does that make my investment is worth CAD 80,000 now?

"Kohl's Corporation (KSS) released its third-quarter earnings report, showing a decrease in net sales and comparable sales. The company reported diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.53, with a decline in inventory of 13%. Additionally, Kohl's updated its full-year 2023 EPS guidance and expressed a commitment to strengthening its balance sheet and maintaining its current dividend.

  
Kohl's net sales in the third quarter decreased by 5.2% compared to the same period last year, amounting to $3.8 billion. Comparable sales also experienced a decline of 5.5%. Despite the decrease in sales, the company managed to improve its gross margin as a percentage of net sales by 158 basis points, reaching 38.9%.

  
The selling, general &amp; administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses increased by 1.9% year-over-year to $1.4 billion. As a percentage of total revenue, SG&amp;A expenses rose by 235 basis points to 33.5%. Operating income for the quarter was $157 million, representing a decrease of 82 basis points compared to the previous year.

  
Net income for the quarter was reported at $59 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, a decline from $97 million, or $0.82 per diluted share, in the same period last year. Inventory for the company decreased by 13%, amounting to $4.2 billion. Operating cash flow stood at $151 million.

  
Looking ahead to the full year 2023, Kohl's revised its guidance. The company now expects net sales to decrease between 2.8% and 4%, which incorporates the impact of a 53rd week worth approximately 1% year-over-year. Previously, the company had anticipated a decrease between 2% and 4%. The guidance for operating margin remains stable at approximately 4.0%.

  
The diluted earnings per share guidance for 2023 was updated to a range of $2.30 to $2.70, excluding any non-recurring charges. The previous guidance range was $2.10 to $2.70. Capital expenditures for the year are expected to fall towards the lower end of the $600 million to $650 million range, encompassing the expansion of the Sephora partnership and store refresh activities.

  
In terms of dividend distribution, Kohl's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.50 per share on November 7, 2023. The dividend will be payable on December 20, 2023, to shareholders of record as of December 6, 2023.

  
Despite beating third-quarter EPS estimates and witnessing improvement in gross margin, Kohl's missed revenue and same-store sales estimates, leading to a drop of over 5% in the stock price. The company stated that warmer weather during the latter part of September and into October impacted demand for fall seasonal goods, particularly in physical stores.

  
Kohl's executives highlighted their intention to be aggressive with holiday season promotions and anticipated that the other revenue streams, primarily the credit business, would perform on par or slightly better than net sales during the fourth quarter.

  
Shares of KSS fell as much as 12% in reaction to earnings. The stock hit $21.51 which marks its 50-day Moving Average. The stock found support and bounced back approximately one point. We would not want to try and play a bounce in this name as analysts will question whether the company will be able to achieve its EPS targets in a highly promotional environment.

"Reddit - what are peoples opinions on doing 100% dividend stocks for later retirement?

I am not a financial planner, merely a moderately experienced private investor. I've been asked to give a once-over of a proposed retirement portfolio for a couple in their mid 70s.

I think a typical strategy for this is just doing a 100 - age stock / bond split, although lately I've been hearing 110 - age or 120 - age. So lets call it 40% stocks / 60% bonds for this discussion. That's the recommendation I would ""expect"" from a financial planner.

Instead, their stock broker is recommending 100% high dividend yield stocks, and specifically, heavily weighted in the ""big 5"" Canadian banks. No bonds.

Thoughts on this? I know there are dividend fans out there, and Canadian banks have a reputation for being very safe in terms of protecting capital. I just haven't seen 100% dividend stocks as a recommendation for a retirement portfolio before.

"Hi all,

I’m in my late 20s and was given a bonus that I can either take in cash or convert to RSUs with an ESPP. I’m looking at this as my “house buying money”, AKA it will hopefully serve as my house down payment in about 3-5 years. 

My company is publicly traded on the NYSE and offers a 25% premium. I think the stock has room to grow/isn’t overvalued currently, although it’s a commercial/logistics real estate company which is a bit scary. 

If I didn’t have the premium, I’d take 100% of it as cash and just buy VTI/VOO. But my parents are insisting going 100% RSUs would be the smarter choice here - part of me is just scared about the worst case what if of something crazy happening with the company. 

Also super important to note that we only follow a 3 year vesting schedule, with 80% being vested year one and the remaining 10% year 2 and 3. This to me seems like a fantastic plan considering I’ve stayed at my previous companies for 1.5-2 years, but I do really like my current job and see it as a company I’d like to remain with for a while.

When people talk about gold and silver protecting us from inflation, I become curious. As when we buy the commodity we trade a set amount of cash for it and then sell it for inflated currency after we are done with it anyways.

Here’s some numbers that may or may not be accurate just as an example.

In Canada we had roughly 3.8% inflation this year. So if I paid for the silver with money before it inflated 3.8% the silver would need to go up by at least 3.8% for me to break even and “protect” myself against inflation. 

We also have to look at lost investment potential of tying up our money into silver or gold.

On Nvidia's previous quarterly earnings call, some analysts were saying it's expected to jump 10% one way or the other after hours. That was exactly what it did.  
I've heard this quarter the move is expected to be 7% one way or the other.

"I am looking to invest a sum in cryptocurrency EFTs.  This is my ‘play money’ and no where near a significant portion of my portfolio.  

The reason I am thinking of going with an ETF vs. buying crypto outright is the idea of not having to deal with the blockchain hassles. Also, I am would prefer a fund either with both bitcoin and ethereum, or, perhaps ethereum only.  I think that ethereum is going to take off because of the relatively low energy use in storing. 

I have looked at the ARK funds, but, so far, they have gotten really mixed reviews.  Also looked into Global X and Grayscale, or, I could wait for the Blackrock or Fidelity digital asset ETFs to be approved.

I know they are relatively new.  

Anyone been thinking about this too?

"Sometimes I'll listen to or read a blurb about how private equity works, and it's always the same thing - something along the lines of PE firms buy a company, saddle it with debt (debt that the company owes, not the PE firm), somehow the PE firms improve the company, and then sell the company. Once sold, the company goes bankrupt trying to service its debt.

This explanation never made much sense to me - how do  these PE firms actually manage to improve a company, since they're not business operators themselves? Also, who would buy these companies from PE, knowing that the company will have trouble paying its debt, and given PE's track record, the company will likely go bankrupt?

"I realize buying individual bonds is probably the better strategy to lock in yields, but what bond funds are good for this purpose? Given that most bond funds typically buy and sell individual bonds before maturity, it's not clear to me what fund choices are optimal for locking in today's relatively high rates. Is BND or AGG good enough, or are there better bond funds to use to lock in yields for the medium term or long term?

"Here is the summary of it!

First, you can cumulatively contribute up to a maximum of 5% of your salary per calendar year (i.e. Q1 contribution + Q2 contribution + Q3 contribution + Q4 Contribution).
Secondly, the interest rate on employee loans is 1%

Employee contributes funds (either by cheque or by loan) and shares are issued based on current market prices (using a five-day weighted average share price) (“Initial Contribution Shares”)
 
- Employee can choose to hold the Initial Contribution Shares in an unregistered account an RRSP account or a TFSA account
 
- All Initial Contribution Shares will receive monthly dividend payments as declared by the directors of company. (Current dividend amount is $0.20/share)
 
- For every 3 Initial Contribution Shares purchased by an individual under the Plan, company will award 1 share at the end of an 18-month vesting period (subject to certain eligibility requirements)
 
- Employee has to remain with a subsidiary of company for 18 months subsequent to the date of issuance of the Initial Contribution Shares in order to qualify to receive the award shares from company
- Employee cannot sell or transfer (to a personal account) any of the Initial Contribution Shares for 18 months in order to qualify to receive award shares from company
 
- Employee will always be allowed to sell some or all of the shares acquired during the 18-month period but will no longer be eligible to receive the award shares at the end of the 18-month period
 
- Company agrees to acquire the number of shares equal to 1/3 of the number of Initial Contribution Shares and will do so at the end of the 18-month period with price fluctuation being companys risk
 
- Company will also issue dividends (0.20$/share) on the awarded shares for those dividends declared by the directors of company during that 18-month vesting period and will do so at the end of the 18-month period
 
- Awarded shares and the dividends received on the awarded shares are considered a taxable benefit and the Employee will be required to remit applicable payroll taxes immediately upon being notified by their Payroll Department.  (Arrangements can be made to pay back taxes by payroll deduction over four payroll periods)





I’ve never worked at a company that offered this program before and am a little lost.  It seems like a nobrainer but the 18 month restriction kind of makes me wary.  Also what do you guys think of the loan?  With the 1% interest it doesn’t seem like a bad option either.

"While it is ultimately up to each individual as to when to sell out of a position, my main hurdle against taking profits is that my money no longer continues growing. I’ve put together a list of 5 assets where I can retire funds to so they can continually compound and retain value. 
1. Real estate:

Pros:  inflation resistant, income potential, price appreciation, something I can control, depreciation. Marginable via helocs 

Cons: would be active management, property taxes, large capital requirements, business risk

2. Cash (for right now)

Pros: risk free 5% rate, no thinking required 

Cons: not always going to yield 5% and 5% only just now keeps up with inflation. Not as much capital appreciation potential.

3. Bonds 

Pros: long term bonds can now provide capital appreciation due to rates poised to come down, high interest payment that can be locked in. Depending on the rate it can be kept up with inflation. 

Cons: not always liquid, not always the best for capital appreciation, bond can default, taxes, not sure if marginable or if it’s even worth it 

4. BRK.B/SPY

Pros: 10-15% a year on average forever, keeps up with inflation, capital appreciation, dividend from SPY, optionable, never under perform the market, marginable

Cons: market risk, business risk at Berkshire,

5. BTC

Pros: inflation resistant, cannot be censored or frozen by gov, lots of capital appreciation, ability to not have to pay taxes on it if I never sell 

Cons: much more volatile, coin can always fail although it’s unlikely, personal risk of losing coins

These are the 5 places I’ve come up with to retire funds in this current market. Im curious to see what others think and if I’m missing anything.

"I'm new to investments and trying to wrap my head around a method to understand, comparatively, if Long Term Bonds are a better choice than the S&amp;P500, for whatever period of time, without assuming anything about the future. Let's make the following assumption: I want to sell my investment in **25 years**.

The S&amp;P 500 currently has a [PE of **24.94**](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-pe-ratio) and a [Earning Yield of **4.01%**](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-earnings-yield).

My question is:

* Why would someone with a 25 years investment horizon, invest in the S&amp;P500 now, that yields **0.75%** less per year?
* I understand one of the possible explanations is that earnings may grow, however interest rates may fall, therefore I'm not sure this is a good explanation.
* I also understand that probably comparing a single data point (4.01% vs 4.76%) it's not a perfect method, as it may just stem from recent volatility of the price of either Stocks or Bonds, however this is how the market is pricing right now, therefore, if I see the investments as a purely ""income generator"", at this stage, Bonds should be preferred.

"Around the internet is common to see articles like [this one](https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/23/11/35837453/goldman-sachs-2024-equity-outlook-winning-stocks-and-sectors-to-watch) that explain the growth of certain markets over the next year.

Given the fact that large cap stocks i.e. GOOGL, MSFT, AAPL, NVIDIA, etc. are the biggest part of the IT sector the combined growth of these stocks should have a huge influence in the growth of the Information Technology stock market for example and in this case since the market is expected to grow then those stocks will likely grow as well.

Let’s make an easy example there are 4 stocks X, Y, W, Z that make up let’s say 60% of an entire market and the remaining 40% is divided across thousands of stocks, if that market is expected to grow by 6% this year then for X, Y, W, Z only have to increase by 10% to make up the entire growth of the market (without considering the other 40% of stocks).

With that said investing on X, Y, W, Z gave me a 10% ROI compared to a 6% if I invested in the entire market.

To me investing on these stocks looks the safest and an easy way to beat the market returns, am I missing something, I think that over diversifying in these cases can be counterproductive.

It’s ok to have a huge part of your portfolio in a stock ETF like VT but in my opinion it’s also important to have a handful of single stocks (large caps and blue chips).",Understanding market growth,17yth9s,1700386301.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17yth9s/understanding_market_growth/,

"I have a mortgage with 27 years remaining in total that is on 4.5% fixed for the next four years. 

I have 80k in cash currently and could pay off half the mortgage. 

If I set up two stocks and shares ISAs (one for me and one for my partner) and add 20k to each this tax year and 20k again next tax year, it looks like I could get, on average 6-8% returns that I can withdraw tax free and use to overpay the mortgage. If I leave in for ten years and pay £100 into the ISA, it looks like I should be able to pay off the mortgage in ten years. 

If I overpay the mortgage by 80k in a lump sum (I'm fortunate that our provider doesn't have an overpayment cap) and 100 a month, it says I will have paid off the mortgage in 8 years. 

I don't really understand how the higher rate takes a longer time to pay off.

"I joined eTrade in 2013 a few years after graduating college. I had set up automatic monthly contributions to my accounts, which I slowly raised over time and mostly invested in blue chip stocks. 

On December 1, 2020, the combined value of my Roth and Traditional Brokerage account was just over $100k. It took me over seven years to get there and was a major milestone.  In the past three years, I have raised my monthly contributions, continued to invest, and am now just shy of $200k at the age of 35. You read about the power of compound gains all the time, but to go from $100k to $200k in three years when the first $100k took seven years is a testiment to that fact.  My goal is $1 mil by 47 and eventually to hit $2.5 mil before I retire. 

For all you youngins out there, stick with it! But also, don't rush the process and try to hit home runs every day. For the most part, I am a buy and hold investor after a year or two of trying my hand at day trading with options and futures. When you chase the money, you won't make it. But if you’re patient with a decent risk tolerance, anything is possible. 



Edit: Wow, thanks for the up votes everyone. It’s been fun reading the comments. Adding some context here based on some of the questions that have come in. Monthly contributions are at $1,000 a month now, but in the early years they were less. When I first started, it was $100 a month and I worked my way up from there. There was a good chunk of time where they were between $200-$500 a month. These accounts were set up on my own, no employer match. I’m not sure what my lifetime performance is, but the last three years I’m up 30% overall. All that in mind, I can confidently say that well over half of my account is due to investment gains. 

Investments have been all individual stocks that I typically hold for a year or longer. I pick them based on both technical and fundamental factors. This is more risky than ETFs and index funds but it suits my investing style and risk tolerance. I try to stick to profitable companies with a stock price that has a history of moving in the right direction, however I also like to buy at a discount price. I keep my eyes on charts and when there’s opportunities to buy at historically undervalued prices I jump on it. There’s really nothing super special to it. Not going to share my current exact portfolio, but stocks I have owned in the past or currently include AAPL, GOOGL, META, COST, HD, MCD, DKNG, AMD, DIS, and BAC to name a few. There are many others I’m interested in buying that are on my watchlist.

I will also add that I’ve made a ton of mistakes along the way. Bad investments, selling too soon when I should of just held, taking risky, over leveraged day trades that resulted in nasty losses and wash sales. However, I’ve learned from them and never done anything bad enough that blew an account or resulted in a draw down that couldn’t be recovered. You can read all the books you want but I’ve always found that the best way is to learn by doing and over time you develop your own skills and are able to trust your own analysis and decisions.","7 years from $0 to $100k, 3 years from $100k to $200k",17yaktc,1700326297.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17yaktc/7_years_from_0_to_100k_3_years_from_100k_to_200k/,

A) Retire early and travel the world, to whichever countries I want.  Staying a month or two in each country or until I've had my fill before moving on to the next country.

B) Retire early and move permanently to Japan (my favorite country that I've been to so far).  No way in hell I would want to work in Japan though.

"Hello fellow investors,  
  
I have been contemplating an idea for some time and would like to get your opinions on it. My idea stemmed from discovering the ability to lend shares on IBKR. I came across the stock ABR (Arbor Realty Trust Inc.) and have been thinking about the potential return from lending out the stock and collecting the dividend (received as lieu dividends on IBKR). Considering the current lending rate of 10.945% and the current dividend yield of 12.43%, one could potentially receive a 17.9025% annualized return, at this moment. This is because IBKR splits the interest 50/50 with the lender. I acknowledge that 10.945% might be unrealistic due to the volatility in lending rates.  
  
[https://companiesmarketcap.com/arbor-realty-trust/cost-to-borrow/](https://companiesmarketcap.com/arbor-realty-trust/cost-to-borrow/)

  
However, my assumption is that the return from lending ABR shares will likely continue to fall between 4-7%, resulting in a net return of 11.9-14.9% annually.  
  
Once I figured that out, my next consideration, which I haven't delved into deeply yet, is to purchase Put Options on ABR. The rationale behind this is to avoid being overly exposed to a significant downside move and to derisk the trade. Arguably one can sell a call option on ABR, to collect a small premium to counter the premium paid for the put option. This derisking will lead to a loss of an additional 1.5-3.5% annual return, as the premium paid for an ABR put is considerably higher than the premium received for the call, resulting in a total return of 8.4-13.4%.  
  
The aspect involving options to reduce risk is hypothetical, and the numbers for the annualized return and the lending rate on IBKR are also speculative. My questions to you are:

  
  
Does this strategy make sense?  
  
What are the risks associated with this strategy, excluding the options part?  
  
For my fellow option users, should and how would you implement options to reduce risk in this strategy?  
  
For IBKR users, is this even possible with IBKR functions, or does IBKR not allow activities like selling options on lent-out shares?  
  
  
  
Please also provide advice and/or improvements for this hypothetical strategy.

"Hey guys - need some advice. My wife’s work offers a DCP (with a limit of $60K). Apparently after tax contributions to DCP can be transferred into a Roth IRA. We can both live comfortably and save just off of my income. We were thinking of doing the following:
1. Max out her 403(b) first with pre-tax money
2. Max out the full $60K to DCP so that we can have tax-free growth in a Roth IRA for as long as we can. 
3. Outside of this, I also max out my own 401(k) and invest the rest 70-30 in VOO and VXUS.

We are both in our early thirties and have time before retirement and have enough in emergency funds. Not thinking of buying a home for the next 3-5 years, so don’t need anything too liquid fast.  At this time, I won’t have to adjust my 401(k) but will likely spend more of my income (reducing my after tax investments).

My 83 yr old father was sold an annuity about 6 years ago. It was funded by putting an existing roth and non qualified account into the annuity.

The annuity is supposed to give him lifetime income even if his account balances go to zero.

My question is, it's been sitting there until just now we've initiated the payments. I feel like he should have initiated the payments long ago. At this point he would have to live another 10 years for this to work out in his favor.

"*Overseas private investors and central banks now own about 30% of all outstanding U.S. government debt, down from roughly 43% a decade ago*

https://www.wsj.com/finance/investing/where-have-all-the-foreign-buyers-gone-for-u-s-treasury-debt-3db75625?mod=hp_lead_pos4

Foreigners no longer have an insatiable appetite for U.S. government debt. That’s bad news for Washington.

The U.S. Treasury market is in the midst of major supply and demand changes. The Federal Reserve is shedding its portfolio at a rate of about $60 billion a month. Overseas buyers who were once important sources of demand—China and Japan in particular—have become less reliable lately.  

Meanwhile, supply has exploded. The U.S. Treasury has issued a net $2 trillion in new debt this year, a record when excluding the pandemic borrowing spree of 2020. 

***“U.S. issuance is way up, and foreign demand hasn’t gone up,”*** said Brad Setser, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. “And in some key categories—notably Japan and China—they don’t seem likely to be net buyers going forward.”

Earlier this month, a U.S. Treasury auction of 30-year bonds was met with tepid demand, spooking markets broadly as investors feared more supply-demand disruptions to come. A group of Wall Street executives that advise the U.S. Treasury, known as the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee, recently flagged waning demand from two big-time buyers: banks and foreigners.

Over the medium term, the committee said it expects “demand from banks and foreign investors to be more limited.”

In response to recent demand weakness, Treasury has shifted to issuing shorter-term bonds that are in higher demand, helping to restore market stability. The yield on the U.S. 10-year note, which shot above 5% in October, is now at around 4.4%. 

***Foreigners, including private investors and central banks, now own about 30% of all outstanding U.S. Treasury securities, down from roughly 43% a decade ago***, according to data from the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.

Overseas investors sold a net $2.4 billion in long-term Treasurys in September, bringing their holdings to $6.5 trillion, according to data from the U.S. Treasury released Thursday. On a rolling 12-month basis, which helps to smooth out volatility in monthly data, the pace of foreign buying has eased to around $300 billion in recent months from levels above $400 billion for much of last year, according to data from the Council on Foreign Relations that also adjusts for changes in valuation.

***The makeup of overseas demand has shifted. European investors bought $214 billion in Treasurys over the past 12 months, according to Goldman Sachs data. Latin America and the Middle East, flush with oil profits, also added to holdings. That has helped offset a $182 billion decline in holdings from Japan and China.***

For some overseas investors such as David Coombs, head of multi-asset investments at U.K. investment manager Rathbones, U.S. government bonds remain an investment too good to pass up. 

Coombs has been buying U.S. Treasurys lately for the first time in 15 years, drawn in by the rise in yields and the chance to compound those returns with exposure to the dollar. Treasurys now make up 9% of his portfolio, even larger than his holding of U.K. bonds and nearly half of his total fixed-income assets.

“In the U.S. it might look a bit bleak, but from our perspective over here, you look in a much better shape than we are,” he said. “You’ve got some real value at these levels.”

Shaniel Ramjee, a fund manager at the Swiss asset manager Pictet, also ramped up purchases of U.S. Treasurys when the U.S. 10-year yield hit 5% last month. Yields rise as prices fall.

Ramjee said he remained concerned about the U.S. government’s widening deficits. But few other developed-market government bonds offer real yields—or interest rates exceeding expected inflation—comparable to those offered by U.S. bonds. 

Demand from private investors in Europe, however, isn’t enough to offset the longer-term structural changes that are weighing on foreign demand for Treasurys, said Praveen Korapaty, chief interest rates strategist at Goldman Sachs.

“Are they actually swinging the needle here? Not really,” he said. “The foreign ownership of Treasurys continues to decline and we expect that will remain the case for the foreseeable future.”

***With the U.S. national debt surpassing $33 trillion and the largest foreign buyers of Treasury bonds reducing their holdings, the government may need some help finding new buyers.*** 

Korapaty doesn’t foresee a demand-doomsday scenario. ***Higher yields have a tendency to draw in new sets of buyers, which lately have included U.S. retail investors.***

Central banks, voracious buyers of U.S. Treasurys in the 2000s and early 2010s, remain a weak spot for overseas Treasury demand. The strength of the dollar has spurred many central banks, including those in China and Japan, to stop adding to their stockpiles of U.S. Treasurys or even to sell them down, analysts say. They use the dollars they get from selling U.S. bonds to buy their own currencies, boosting the value.

At the same time, China has diversified reserves away from Treasurys and has been investing in bonds backed by U.S. government agencies such as Freddie Mac that offer higher yields than Treasurys. China has bought a net $32 billion of those in the year through August, according to data from the Council on Foreign Relations.  

Japanese private investors—including banks, pensions and insurers—are a source of worry. Many have invested heavily in U.S. Treasurys as a way to escape ultralow, and at times negative, interest rates at home. Between those investors and the Bank of Japan, the country is the largest foreign holder of U.S. Treasurys with a stockpile worth more than $1 trillion.

The Bank of Japan has allowed government bond yields to rise as the country finally looks set to escape its deflationary spiral, which should encourage investors to invest more in the domestic government bond market.

So far, the central bank’s move hasn’t resulted in a huge change to demand. Japanese investors were net sellers of long-term U.S. Treasurys last year but have returned to buying in 2023. 

Masatoshi Yamauchi, an executive officer at All Nippon Asset Management, whose main clients include regional banks, said Japanese banks have continued to invest in U.S. Treasurys, but with shorter durations, and without hedging currency risk, which is currently very costly for Japanese investors. But they, too, might soon lose interest in the U.S., he warned.

“They are getting full,” he said. “Interest rates are becoming more attractive in their mother market.”

Some observations:

1) This news is bullish for oil (caveat, am long in oil).  We've seen how Japan and China being voracious buyers of treasuries in the past influenced government policy to be more amenable to favorable trade relations with them, so if oil producing countries are increasing their buying, then it may influence US policy to be more amenable to higher oil prices, especially considering that the US is the #1 producer in the world.

2) The tendency towards higher yields to attract foreign buyers for treasuries will likely counteract whatever domestic pressures there may be to lower rates by the Fed.  As the Fed is currently back to 90s Goldilocks rates, IMHO any predilections towards lower rates in the future are likely misplaced.",Where Have All the Foreign Buyers Gone for U.S. Treasury Debt?,17xg92p,1700231231.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17xg92p/where_have_all_the_foreign_buyers_gone_for_us/,
"I'm intrigued by the stringent regulations surrounding private debt products, especially given the limited accessibility for retail investors. The availability private debt products is rather restricted, with only a few ETFs accessible to the public, and Private Credit Funds reserved for high-net-worth individuals. On a theoretical level, debt instruments like loans and bonds seem more suitable for non-expert investors due to their typically lower volatility and seniority in the capital structure, ensuring repayment priority in case of bankruptcy.

  
Consider the scenario where a retail investor is prohibited from acquiring a portion of a private corporate loan issued to a highly liquid and information-disclosed entity like Apple. On the flip side, these same investors can readily engage in options trading through platforms like Robinhood. This regulatory incongruity raises questions about the rationale behind limiting access to seemingly lower-risk investments while allowing participation in more complex and risk-laden options trading.  


While I acknowledge the liquidity aspect, where bond investments typically involve a committed holding period compared to the more fluid nature of equity transactions, I wonder if there are additional facets to this regulatory framework that I might be overlooking. Any nuanced insights into this regulatory dichotomy would be greatly appreciated.",Is regulation on private credit too strict?,17xdzxn,1700224143.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17xdzxn/is_regulation_on_private_credit_too_strict/,
"As the reporting CPI numbers got lower, Fed skipping the hike for now, everything pointing towards a nice short term rally.  The last 2 weeks have been nice, possibly unbelieving if you are holding leveraged ETFs.  But upon studying these ETFs that supposedly give 3x the return, I noticed something.  On TQQQ for instance, easiest comparison in the world against QQQ.  While there should be 3x the swing, the graph should theoretically look similar, but no, that's not what happened.  

For QQQ, we are slowly creeping up to its all-time high around $400.  That means even for the unluckiest dude who bought at the absolute peak, his chance to even things out might be coming.

It's even worse for SOXL which barely has a third left.

We know lump sum outperforms DCA 2/3s of the time but lump summing a large amount of cash at near all time highs would be a psychological hurdle. DCA at that point at least ensures you're not trying to time the market and keeps you invested with a straightforward and easy to follow plan.

So, firstly, for those who don't remember that whole Walgreen's and Rite Aid merger mess. In short: they promised to buy out Rite Aid in 2015, but then in 2017 tried to duck out of it to avoid trouble.   
Well, they got slapped with a bunch of lawsuits for it and recently they decided to [pay big $192.5M settlement](https://11thestate.com/cases/rad-wba-shareholder-settlement) just before the court (btw you can check it if you traded it back then).

Moreover, they brought in Tim Wentworth as the new CEO. and I personnaly highly doubt the success of that.

And as a result (though it might have been a long time coming), their stocks are looking like this now. As OverlookedAlpha tweets: ""Walgreens $WBA continues to tank - closing Monday at a 25-year low (!!). The stock is down 46% in 2023, which would be its worst year ever.""

"Trying to come up with a vague idea of a plan or at least a direction.
We have a property; its been in the family for three generations and is worth about 2.6m. There is 500k in a mortgage that was taken out to support my grandparents.. I'm now saddled with paying for it. its a 15-year ARM and is now at 6% for the next 12 months resulting in a 5k a month payment. The property is being used as an Airbnb, it did fairly well till this last year. There were several months of nothing due to the weather, and then Airbnb shadow-banned us. So this year, it barely broke even. that said, we have listed the property, and hopefully, it will get the asking amount.

There is quite a bit of carry forward losses and stepped-up value that if I weren't to do a 1031, there would only be like 100k in cap gain taxes. So, buying property in a 1031 may not be the only or best option.

So here comes the dilemma: what to do with the funds if it does sell. My primary residence is taken care of by my other half. we want to move to something larger, but where the rates are, it doesn't make sense.

What are your objectives with this money? (Buy a house? Retirement savings?) -- I don't know... see above
What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs? It depends on when this property sells.
What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?) I'm somewhere in the middle, but depending on the ability to get out of the investment, I might be open to a bit more risk.

"I currently have investments in various ETFs/stocks, including covered call ETFs like JEPQ, which is based off of the NASDAQ100.  A common criticism of covered call ETFs is that the underlying index fund will likely outperform the covered call ETF in the long run due to less NAV erosion, higher gains, etc.  so that younger folks are probably better off with VOO, NDX, etc.

NASDAQ100 has a higher volatility than the S&amp;P500 due to its higher tech profile.  However, JEPQ's volatility, while lower than NASDAQ 100, seems on par with a lower volatility index like S&amp;P500 while offering a considerable dividend of \~10%.  And since both JEPQ and VOO hold many of the same stocks, it's not surprising that their movements often track with each other.

Given the similar volatility between JEPQ and the S&amp;P500 (e.g. VOO), what are some additional risks associated with JEPQ that may cause JEPQ to significantly underperform VOO in the short or long run?

For reasons known only to youtube's algo it started suggesting content relating to the UAE stock exchange, and I made ""the mistake"" of watching a couple (now it's obsessively showing those, of course… lol). Now truth is I love charting and I got curious, so I started playing around with technically analyzing their index. I'd like to share, just for fun and making no recommendations whatsoever, a brief opinion and what I consider the most likely future scenarios for this market. Charts in links btw.  
  
It's worth noting that available data starts March 30th 2022, not a ton of it around then. Having said that I was impressed with how smooth the auction seems to be, was expecting to see a very gap rich chart, but they seem to have nice market making going on. Volumes look ok as well, and generally speaking it looks like a very tradable market/instrument, even on intraday though I'm not gonna go there here. One last thing, I'd absolutely love to hear different takes, macro perspectives and whatnot. Those will be really fun to read actually so please share if you got any!  
  
As things stand, I think the probability of a move higher, back into that trading range, is the most likely move. I believe it has some more trading to do there before we can see the next expansion.  
  
Let's start, [this is a daily chart](https://postimg.cc/svrj2dx8) with zones of expected resistance marked. They are based on analysis of price structure along with some math I like to use. The two with the golden caps are the strongest medium-term price attractors. That most recent dip set a new all -time low AFAICT, and it looks like it's been in a hurry to reject those prices, at least for now. [The second](https://postimg.cc/SXJqPm1X) is a zoomed in view for better understanding this potential swing failure, and the shorter-term attractors we can expect. Again, in my opinion.

[Next](https://postimg.cc/y3zHWc19), I added two volume profiles to see if confluences presented themselves, and they have (good indication for me). The orange/red on the left is of the range this market has been in since March, the blue/grey one on the right is for all available data. Both set for 100 points per row. The most important confluences are marked with red ellipses. Note confluences between marked areas and VP's edge of value, edges of low volume node, and the big profile's VPOC. I didn't mark it as to not add more visual pieces to an already busy chart, but it's worth noting how the two profiles have their lower edge of value around the same prices, that's the most immediate battleground imo.

So now we have a map let's talk general scenarios. The different colors of my squiggles indicate different phases and may be separated by consolidations. I tried to mark where I think such a consolidation is likely to happen, but what I'm trying to say is that these are general trajectories meant to help illustrate my thoughts, and are not necessarily descriptive of the manner in which the market will play such moves out.  
  
Since the most likely move imo is back to trading the range I'll start with [the bullish](https://postimg.cc/p94xb33s) squiggles.  
But life is both up and down so we obviously have a look at [the bearish](https://postimg.cc/47cGJBgs) side of things too. Downside targets are calculated prices as there's no available past data.

Again, in the immediate term I think we are mostly likely to see this market trade the 9100-9700 range for a while more, but there was no point in squiggling that one hahaha.  
  
Hope you found this an enjoyable read, as I said at the start I'd love to hear additional takes!

Altus group just published Q3 2023 earnings of $185.2 million, up from Q3 2022 of $177.9 M, down from Q2 2023 of $205.21 M. Missing analyst expectations but the stock price is down almost 22% after close. 

It seems their business is solid, (as solid as can be in this sector) with strong reoccurring revenue in their analytics business of $87.4 million. This to me seems amazing given that ARGUS is the “gold” standard in the CRE financial management business. Is the office market affecting CRE as a whole that much? Industrial and multifamily seems to be still holding on their values and retail is only sliding by a bit compared to office. 

Altus seems to be targeting big institutional players in Canada and starting in the US, with big expansions in their US business. I think if I recall it’s up to 50% of their business by revenue is from the US now.

"Hi friends!
I am lucky to have a lot of generational wealth. 
Up until last year, my father ( portfolio manager) has been managing my investment account. 
Now it is being handle by his friend however, I feel like the fees are high. Since my father wasn’t charging me anything. I have no real sense of what acceptable fees are or if I’m better off doing something else for my investments ( like doing it on my own)

I am selling my condo because I would rather have my money in investments than real estate. This will bring my portfolio up to approx. 958,000$ the fee percentage goes down but I’m still giving the portfolio manager 8,000$ a year in fees.

Is this yearly fee worth having them deal with all of the admin stuff?

**THESIS SUMMARY**  
As of Nov 1, 2023, Net Lease Office Properties (NLOP) is a tiny, ugly, spinoff of W. P. Carey Inc (WPC). No one likes this thing. Due to poor sentiment, poor spinoff execution, a bad spin ratio, a large difference between the asset type of the Parent and SpinCo, uncertainty about the value of its assets, and even just the size of the company (sub-200m market cap), it's currently undergoing a heavy sell-off. Management from the Parent are going to also be running NLOP. They're going to be issued 750k shares and 1.5m options which haven't been struck yet, so they're incentivized to see a low initial trading price for the shares. NLOP's assets are high quality (even more so considering the craziness surrounding the office property industry at the moment), with large stable tenants, a reasonable WALT, and a low vacancy rate. Adjusted book value is 3.7x their current price. This book value will be realized over the next few years because the purpose of spinning off NLOP was to liquidate the assets without a fire sale. Oh, and the cherry on top is a likely 16%+ annual dividend while you wait for the properties to be sold.

  
**INTRODUCTION**  
W. P. Carey Inc (WPC) is a multi-billion dollar REIT that owns a variety of properties spanning Industrial, Retail, Warehouse, Office, and Self-Storage. They're seeing carnage in the Office segment; there are parts of Houston and San Fran with 30% vacancy rates. Since WPC has low vacancy rates with a reasonable WALT and great tenants, they figure now is the best time to sell their office properties.

In addition, WPC is trading for a low AFFO multiple of 11x. This is close to Office REITs in general, which trade on average at 10.2x AFFO. They're trading at an Office multiple, even though Office Properties are only a tiny portion of their overall portfolio. As a REIT, this makes it hard for them to raise equity in a way that accretive - their cost of equity is too high.

So, they started to sell their properties and they've made progress in a short period of time (you can look up their Office Sale Program that's set to complete by the end of 2023). But they have 59 office properties remaining which they do not want to sell in a fire sale because it doesn't make sense to do so. These are long-term tenants like Google, CVS Health Corp , and McKesson. The best way to get their cake and eat it too is to spin these properties off into Net Lease Office Properties (NLOP). NLOP will seek to sell off these assets over time, so no fire sale. And WPC immediately justifies a higher multiple to lower their cost of equity by getting rid of their toxic waste.  

""Obviously, I was excited about... the toxic waste."" - Joel Greenblatt
  
**THE SPINOFF**  
On Nov 1, 2023, WPC issued one NLOP common share for every 15 shares of W. P. Carey common stock outstanding. This resulted in 14,261,721 NLOP shares outstanding. NLOP accounts for 58 (14.6%) of WPC's tenants, 59 (4%) of their properties, 141.5m (9.6%) of their ABR, and 1.7B in gross RE value. Overall, they're not getting rid of many properties, but the properties are actually more valuable than WPC's properties on average (i.e. only 4% of properties, but 8.3% of gross value and 9.6% of rent). Additionally, NLOP has more investment grade tenants than WPC as a whole.  

In executing the spin, NLOP is taking on debt (see below), and is paying WPC a 350m dividend which WPC will use to pay off their own debt. After all this shuffling around, NLOP has about 590m in consolidated debt, which will be paid off incrementally as properties are sold off.
  
**SENTIMENT**  
Part of this whole spin-off process will involve cutting WPC's dividend to about 70-75% of AFFO (previously it was \~80%). To say that their current shareholders are upset is putting it mildly. The sentiment is vitriolic.  

The anger  
Over the history of WPC, they've attracted a specific shareholder base that wants dividend income with a safe yield that ""never goes down"". They've attracted this investor base over decades. These investors wanted utility-like cash-flow predictability. Here's what those investors get instead: WPC is ending a 24-year dividend streak. In the minds of REIT investors, this makes them ""feel betrayed"". A lot of their investors believe there was no other reason to hold the REIT - the dividend was the only reason.  

Uncertainty over the safety of their assets  
WPC didn't even cut their dividend during the GFC - one of the few REITs that didn't. That means investors believe management's confidence in the business is at 24-year lows. The weighted average lease at WPC is 9 years, and newest acquisitions have 20-year leases. Nothing wrong with that, so it must be something else... Investors think the only reason for a dividend cut is that the non-office portfolio is somehow not as high quality as management led investors to believe. Further to this, rating agencies say the ""safe payout ratio"" for a triple net REIT is 90%. What does that say about the safety if management dropped it to 70-75%? Management didn't even announce that they were considering this, so investors believe this was some sort of ""emergency action"".  

S&amp;P bulletin says they like the deal and that it's credit neutral, but the investors' response is that S&amp;P only cares that WPC can keep paying interest on its bonds and doesn't go bankrupt. Investors aren't saying WPC is a dying company, but they don't like the idea of owning a 5.9% yielding REIT where they believe management has just said there's something very wrong with the rest of its property portfolio.  

""This thing is a value trap. The long term chart goes nowhere. The stock is 10 points higher than where it was 10 years ago. I'm looking elsewhere."" - Disgruntled shareholder 
 
Poor spinoff ratio and execution  
I love this spin ratio. 15:1, and only 4% of WPC's properties. Additionally, it's intended to be a taxable distribution, so some people are going to have to sell the shares to pay the tax on them - or even if they don't sell the shares, they will owe tax based on the initial trading value of those shares  

""I'll probably just sell off the new shares as I don't have that many WPC shares where I'd end up with a decent position on 15:1 basis."" - Another disgruntled shareholder  

Institutional selling  
Right now, the market cap of NLOP is \~185m. It's spinning out of WPC which has a market cap of $12 Billion. It contains only office properties, which is substantially different from the remaining portfolio. 20% of shareholdings of WPC belong to Vanguard and Blackrock. Other institutional holders are probably selling this too given the differences in size and asset type.  

The counterpoint (aka. the reality)  
The whole point of this exercise is to realize more value in their shares. And yet, in the short term, their shares are undervalued - but they still need to grow. From a capital allocation perspective, it makes much more sense to retain earnings that can be funneled into new growth than issue new shares - at least until the shares start trading at the higher multiple the RemainCo properties deserve. This is why I believe they cut the dividend. Doing what's right in the face of criticism is actually a strong demonstration of capital allocation skills. Analysts now predict they will grow at 4%. 
 
This sentiment and sell-off of WPC also applies to NLOP. In fact, I believe NLOP is getting rage-sold even harder. Here we have the bastard child of a hated REIT, full of office properties that ""everyone knows"" are imploding. In this situation, it's important to keep an eye on management. So, what is management doing? 
 
**MANAGEMENT**  
The CEO, CFO, and Chief Controller are going to be running NLOP. In return, they're compensated with Advisory Fees that amount to 7.5m/year. This amount decreases over time as they continue to sell the properties (in proportion to the properties remaining). In addition, they've created a stock incentive award plan that could be very lucrative for themselves. They've reserved 750k common shares and 1.5m shares issued in connection with stock options under their Incentive Award Plan. Since there's no other staff, these shares and options will be split among management and the board.  

These shares and options have not been granted as yet. As such, management benefits from a massive initial sell-off of the shares to ensure their options get struck at as low a price as possible. Let's just say they're not saying anything that would make their shareholders feel better. In addition, board members (i.e. non-employee trustees) have a dollar cap limit on any awards granted. That means the lower the price, the more options and shares they can be given.  

To summarize what we have so far, we have a hated, tiny REIT of office properties with an ""ick"" factor. Institutions don't want it. Other shareholders don't want it. The management - the executors of the plan - are coming over to manage the spin. They're being incentivized appropriately, and they even benefit from a low initial share price. Sounds good to me. Let's take a look at the REIT itself. 
 
**NLOP ASSETS**  
\- 59 properties  
\- 1.7B gross property value  
\- 62 tenants  
\- 8.7m sqft  
\- Annualized Based Rent (ABR) of \~141.5m, almost all located in the US  
\- 89% North America, 11% Europe  
\- WALT (weighted average lease term) 5.7 years  
\- Occupancy 97.1%  
\- Investment grade tenants 66.9%  
\- Rent 16.21/sqft  

In terms of rent escalations, 21% of their properties are CPI linked. 73% fixed. 6% other (e.g. leases with a percentage rent, like participation in gross revenues, as well as those with no escalations) 
 
Since these are ""Net Office Leases"", tenants are responsible for upkeep on the properties. This greatly limits their maintenance capex. In addition, because they're looking to liquidate over time, they won't be spending anything on growth capex. Depreciation is large in comparison to capex. 
 
I went through each one of the 59 properties to assess whether management's gross value claim is in the ballpark. I found the address of most properties, looked up that area, and found a sample of office properties for sale in that area. I sorted that sample by cap rate, found the highest cap rate (i.e. lowest resale value), rounded up, and used that cap rate to estimate the value of each of their properties.  

For example, KBR, Inc is located at 601 Jefferson St, Houston, TX 77002, United States. In Houston, at the 77002 zip code, I found a number of office properties for sale. The highest cap rate I found was \~7.5%. This likely included much smaller properties with higher cap rates, but regardless, I included them to be conservative. I rounded that up to 8% and used an 8% cap rate to value the property based on the rent amount the company disclosed. 
 
I did this for all 59 properties, and the value I came up with was 1.76B in value, which roughly matches the disclosed gross value of 1.7B. As such, I'm confident that management might be being conservative in their stated gross value. 
 
**CORPORATE STRUCTURE AND DEBT**  
There are three types of debt in NLOP: Non-recourse mortgages, a secured term loan, and a mezzanine loan. The non-mortgage debt has a total gross value of 455m. After paying out the dividend to WPC, accounting for the mortgage debt, and shuffling a bunch of stuff around, total consolidated debt is 590m.  

The non-mortgage debt is structured in a complicated fashion. NLOP owns a subsidiary (""NLOP Mezzanine Borrower""), which owns a certain number of properties and has a loan (the Mezzanine Loan of $120m) with those properties as collateral. NLOP Mezzanine Borrower also owns another subsidiary (""NLOP Mortgage Loan Borrowers""), which also owns a certain number of properties, and also has a loan (the Term Loan of $335m) with its properties as collateral.  

I initially tried to go about this by trying to identify which properties belong to each subsidiary, but that isn't disclosed in the loan agreements. Instead, each property falls under its own LLC, and it's those LLCs that are mentioned in the loan agreements - not the properties themselves. But perhaps we can figure this out with just the information given. 
 
Out of the total 59 properties, 40 of them reside in the subs and are deemed the ""Mortgaged Properties"". The company stated that there was a ""loan-to-value ratio of approximately 43% with respect to the Mortgaged Properties, implying a value of approximately $163 per square foot for the Mortgaged Properties."" There are 8.68m square feet in all 59 properties. If that $/sqft metric was applied to all 59 properties, it means the lender is assigning a value of 1.4B to all the properties, and we've already been told they have a gross value of 1.7B, so this is a 17% margin of safety for the bank.  

Since we know the value of the loan (455m), and we have the LTV ratio of 43%, we know that the 40 properties in the subs have a value assigned by the bank of 1,058m (out of their of total 1.4B). This means the bank has a loan against 74.8% of the total gross value of all 59 properties.  

This means the remaining 25.2% of gross value is \~428m (1.7B x 25.2%), which applies to the remaining 19 properties. There is $168.5m in non-recourse mortgages against 14 of these properties. Since this debt is non-recourse, we'll assume this mortgage debt is against all 19 properties.  

Netting out the mortgages leaves you with 260m, and the current market cap is 185m. This is a great deal except in one scenario... 
 
**RISK**  
These are office properties. Vacancy rates are at all-time highs, perhaps due to WFH trend that might be a sea change. The longer interest rates stay high, the more we're going to see businesses go under, which isn't a rosy picture for their respective office buildings. Plus, as soon as the leases expire, they can be very costly and difficult to re-lease. Tenants know this and so they're in a strong position to negotiate lower rents and expensive improvements. 

It's likely we may find that these properties sell for significantly below value. How much below? It's hard to say, and therein lies the uncertainty. I think if commercial office real estate falls through the floor, and we have a situation of a 57% drop in value of these properties (i.e. GFC 2: Electric Boogaloo), here's what happens:  

The LTV on the Mortgaged Properties hits 100%, giving the company incentive to default. The bank takes 74.8% of your gross value. You're left with 19 properties with a gross value of 428m, which has in all likelihood dropped 57% too, so you're left with 184m in gross value. Subtract the mortgages, and your remaining equity is 15.5m.
  
I believe this is very unlikely for a few reasons.  


1. The tenants are very high quality and are diversified across multiple industries. We're talking the likes of FedEx, Total E&amp;P, JPMorgan, McKesson, Siemens, etc. Even if we go through a painful time, and even if these companies all look to renegotiate their leases, I find it doubtful that every one of these companies will be able to request 50%+ long term decreases in rent.
2. The WALT on these properties is 5.7 years. The GFC lasted 1.5 years, so the lease term itself would outlast a very long recession
3. The company is aware of this risk and is taking steps to sell all their properties to pay off debt and distribute the proceeds. Every single sale mitigates risk.
4. You're collecting a hefty dividend (see below) that also mitigates your risk substantially  


With that bit of highly improbable ugliness out of the way, what might this be worth? 
 
**VALUATION**  
NLOP is looking to liquidate their assets in a controlled manner while they pay off debt and distribute the proceeds to shareholders. As a result, I believe the best way to look at this is to value to the assets on the balance sheet. However, I also included other metrics below for completeness. In terms of the balance sheet, as a result of the spin, many of these assets are already marked to fair value. I updated the balance sheet from Dec 2022 to the numbers provided in the pro forma statements in Jun 2023. I also adjusted a couple of line items to be conservative.  

After making the adjustments detailed below, book value is 689m or $48.13/sh. This is 3.7x higher than the current market price of $13/sh.  
Adjustments to the Balance Sheet

1. In-place lease intangible assets: I've kept this value as-is. There are certain costs involved in getting a property leased by a tenant. This includes rent lost during downtime, rent concessions, leasing commissions, etc. As long as a tenant is occupying the property, these costs do not have to be borne by the property owner. This has value, in the sense that if the properties are acquired without a tenant, the acquiring company would have to pay this cost to get someone in. Since there’s already someone in there, the acquiring company should reimburse the selling company for this cost.
2. Above-market rent intangible assets: This represents the portion of some leases that are being paid above market. It gets amortized over the life of the lease. I set this to zero to make the assumption that every single tenant may try to renegotiate back down to a market rent.
3. Goodwill: Set to zero.
4. Below-market rent intangible liabilities: This is the value of the amount of below-market rents currently being paid. I kept this liability on the balance sheet for conservatism.

Other Valuation Metrics  
Total Debt (millions) ... 590  
Cash ............................ 55.63  
Noncontrolling interest 4.63  
Market Cap................... 185  
Adjusted book ............. 689  
EV ................................. 725  
EBITDA-Capex.............. 114  
Price/Book 26.9%  
Earnings Yield (EBITDA-Capex/EV) 15.7%  
EV Multiple 6.3X  

**DIVIDENDS**  
The dividend policy should roughly match WPC, given that the same management is running it. WPC used to dividend out \~80% of AFFO. This was dropped to 70-75% to finance growth. Since NLOP will not be growing, it's likely that the dividend will be higher than the new dividend at WPC. My best guess would be 80% of AFFO, but I'm going to assume 60%. This is less than the 70% payout ratio of WPC, in case NLOP wishes to pay off their debt faster.  

In the six months ended on Jun 30, 2023, AFFO was 48.1m. Over the year, you're looking at 96m of AFFO. I'm getting 47m in interest expense, leaving 49m in AFFO.  
Based on a 60% payout ratio (and it's likely to be higher), this works out to 30m, or $2.06/sh. You're collecting a 16%+ annual dividend while you wait for these properties to be sold.  

**TOTAL RETURN**  
Let's assume it takes 4 years to sell off all the properties. We'll assume the dividend decreases by 25% each year as properties get sold. Here's what the return looks like:  

Distributions from sale of properties (aka adjusted Book Value): 689m, or $48.31/sh 

Dividends (per sh): 2.06 (yr 1) + 1.55 (yr 2) + 1.03 (yr 3) + 0.52 (yr 4) = 5.16/sh  

Total return over 4 years: $53.47/sh, or 42% CAGR

EDIT: 
Someone mentioned that I cannot annualize the AFFO given for H1 because they sold a few properties in H1. If you annualize their revenues, you get 170m. But really, it should be ~141m. After inputting the new ABR number, and subtracting G&amp;A and property expenses, I'm getting an EBITDA-Capex of ~85m. After interest, I'm at 38m. 

How this changes things: 
1. This lowers the capital they have to issue a dividend from 49m to 38m.
2. This changes the valuation metrics indicated above (e.g. earnings yield is now ~11%)","Net Lease Office Properties (NLOP) - A classic ""toxic waste"" spinoff (Long thesis)",17ujkrp,1699906239.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17ujkrp/net_lease_office_properties_nlop_a_classic_toxic/,

*YTD Share Performance of Major Dating Apps:*  
\- Grindr: +25%

\- Bumble: -32%  
\- Spark Networks: -98%  


**Take-Aways:** I’m no expert on the dating apps (I’ve been with my wife since I was a pimple-faced school boy) but think there is a broader theme that investors need to be cautious of; that things trendy with the twentysomethings can evaporate quite quickly.

\- Blue Apron: -99%

  
Companies like GoPro and Snapchat were all extremely popular at one time but things change - and often quickly. A key term for investors is that of a ‘moat’: characteristics ingrained in your business model that makes it hard for competitors or copy-cats to come along and steal your market share. While things like a company’s ‘brand’ can be an example of a moat, ‘popularity’ isn’t the same thing. Brands are built over years from their connection to things like quality (Volvo), trustworthiness (Wall Street Journal) or coolness (Hermes).  


*Examples of Economic Moats:*  


* **Low-Cost Producers:** Provide a low cost that is usually based on significant economies of scale. Examples include Walmart, Southwest, FedEx.
* **High Switching Costs:** Material expense (money, time, effort) required in order to move to competitor. Examples include Salesforce, Oracle, Microsoft.
* **Network Effect:** Value to customer increases with the number of people on the platform. Examples include Ebay, Uber, Reddit.
* **Intangible Assets:** Brand names, intellectual property, trade secrets, government approvals. Examples include Pfizer, Nvidia, Coca-Cola.

  
Moreover, often these companies that achieve near overnight success do so because their business doesn’t require significant time, expense or technological sophistication in order to reach such a scale. Looking at the companies I've mentioned, in nearly every case some smart folks with a laptop can replicate their business model; improve on it; and steal their customers. In essence, the things that can be built quickly, are often built on sand.

"I'm hoping that this is a simple question. It's something that I'm just curious about.

When I look at a 7-day yield graph for a MMF I'm in, it shows values for business days (market days), but not weekends or market holidays.

But the MMF continues to draw a yield. So my question is: What rate applies to the weekends and holidays?

For example, a MMF was 4.98% on Fri. 1 Sept. and 4.97% on Tues. 5 Sept. (Mon. 4 Sept. was Labor Day.)

What rate was applied for Sept. 2 to 4?

This is just an example. Obviously it's practically trivial. But I'm just curious: Exactly how are weekend and holiday rates determined?

Here, Friday's 4.98%? Tuesday's 4.97%? An average??

Note: I realize that MM yields are in fact determined by actual factors. It doesn't use an equation that can be modeled, like a mortgage.

The advantage I see of the save-receipts approach is that the $1k wouldn’t experience tax drag in my HSA.

The advantage I see of taxable is that it’s going to be taxed lower upon withdrawal if I use it for non-medical expenses. (Assume withdrawal after 65, so no penalty if taken from HSA). Plus, there’s no risk of policy changes around when I can reimburse receipts.

To me these sort of cancel each other out, with taxable actually seeming to come out ahead if my ordinary income tax bracket is higher than, say, 15% in retirement.

"After testing high points, the big tech and large growth funds seem well on the track to reversing all their gains this year. It's hard for me not to recognize that 5.3% APR on the funds that track T-bill rates would've performed a lot better in my 401(k) than my current selections, as this year's contributions pretty much ended up at net zero return.

Inevitably everything will break upwards past this funk in the long term, but I personally believe the next black swan will dip the market below (possibly, well below) its current level. I'm not convinced we're anywhere near out of the thicket, so I'd like to park everything in a T-bill fund, the idea being to sit out the larger drop I foresee happening eventually; then move it all back whenever things are looking truly awful, and ride the market back.

I'm aware it's traditionally inadvisable to attempt ""timing"" the market, but I don't expect to time the bottom, and going back in at any point below the current will result in a gain. I'm probably wrong about all of this speculation, but this is a low-risk move I am willing to take before I start losing much more. I'm definitely not of the ""forget it until you retire"" mentality and I do prefer to keep an eye on the market, at least enough so as to make moves according to what I think will lead to a significant benefit in the end.

I'm not anywhere near retirement, but would really enjoy the boost if this goes to plan. At least there is a guaranteed positive return, and 5.3% at that. I also reason that even if things go sideways for a couple more years, this move would vastly outperform. The risk of course is getting left ""in the dust"", but I feel like 5.3% is nothing to scoff at for a safe and guaranteed hold, and so much better than just sitting in cash.

I give all this context for discussion purposes, but my question boils down to UTIXX vs VMFXX. VMFXX is Vanguard's big fund for this purpose. UTIXX is from Federated Hermes, and fees are the same. Is there anything I'm not noticing here, and are there any pros to UTIXX over VMFXX? If not, I suppose I'll just go with Vanguard's fund considering its AUM is about 5.5x that of the other, and I'd never heard of the other fund family.

"So I want to put 250$ a week into ""something."" I want to make sure I understand each option.

Without going into tons of details assume I have 401k and pension that will cover retirement and this is more of a long term savings account.

ETFs (Specifically VOO): 8% or so return over a long period. Not secured. Could be 1% after several months and jump 10% the next few months (i.e. volatile). Lower taxes if held for a long time?

T-bills: 5.39% return, money is locked for 3+ months. Lower tax liability compared to HYSA. How does this work for adding funds weekly? Do I end up with a bunch of T-bills with different maturity dates?

HYSA: 4.5%. Secure. Seems to be the easiest and most like a traditional savings account. Rate will vary over time. Money is available same day.

I'm probably missing something so hoping to learn more about each option or something else I haven't considered.

ETFs seem a bit risky for this kind of short/medium term investing.

I am leaning towards T-bills or HYSA. Basically I want to setup some kind of auto-buy or deposit with fidelity (t-bills) or my bank (HYSA). T-bills seem like they would take a bit more work, because on maturity I would have to manually reinvest that amount into more t-bills plus the interest accrued. A HYSA just deposits the interest into itself and is kind of set it and forget it.

I realize these rates can change over time and in two years t-bills might be 3% or a HYSA might be 2.5% and at that point I would have to reevaluate.

I hopefully this is enough info for some general advice. Thanks in advance.","ETFs, Bonds, or HYSA? What is optimal?",17tvtsa,1699828600.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17tvtsa/etfs_bonds_or_hysa_what_is_optimal/,
"I am curious about the rules and potential strategy when it comes to withdrawing from a Roth IRA in order to make a down payment on a house.

Currently, I have a traditional, pre-tax, 401k through my employer. I contribute 15% of every paycheck to it and my employer matches 5%, giving me a total of 20% each paycheck.

I also hold a traditional Roth IRA that I have maxed out the last two years ($6,000 in 2022, $6,500 in 2023) for a total contribution thus far of $12,500.

I have a savings account that I deem an ‘emergency fund/potential future down payment for a home purchase’. That has roughly $20,000 in it.

After reading online, it seems I am allowed to withdraw any and all contributions from my Roth IRA at any point after 5 years with no penalty. This counts for ONLY funds I have contributed, not any of the growth the IRA gains over that time span.

My question is this: is it a smart strategy to take $7,000 of my ‘emergency/house fund’ at the beginning of 2024 and dump it into my Roth IRA with the intention of eventually taking it out for a future home purchase? Or does it make more sense to leave that money in my emergency fund and re-adjust my 401k contributions going forward to try and max out my Roth IRA during 2024 throughout the course of the year using the money from my paycheck?

Granted, I don’t need all $20,000 I currently have as an emergency fund. That number is probably closer to $12,000 - $15,000.",Roth IRA vs. Home Purchase,17tvev4,1699827478.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17tvev4/roth_ira_vs_home_purchase/,
"Despite our best efforts, my wife and I attempted to teach our children (now all adults) the value of investing.  However, not a single one of them has a 401k, an IRA, nor a taxable brokerage account.  For Christmas this year, rather than hand them money or buy gifts - we'd really like to setup an investment account for each of our adult children that they (or we) can contribute to.

Is it possible for us to setup an investment account (one for each of our adult children) that would allow them (or us) to contribute to the account but HERE'S THE IMPORTANT PART, we do not want the child to be able to pull money out of the account and/or sell the investments.

Here are a few ideas I had (welcome more input from you all):

1. Create a taxable brokerage account in our names (mom and dad) for each child so that we have full control over the account but give the child access to deposit money into the account (and setup automatic investing anytime money is available).  We would then list them as sole beneficiary of their investment account in case of our death.  The only drawback I see here is that we (mom and dad) would be responsible for taxes on dividends.
2. Create a taxable brokerage account in the name of each of our children (and use their SSN, mailing address, etc.) but we don't give them the login information - just the routing/account number so they can contribute to it.  Drawback here of course is they could call the brokerage and update login/account details which kinda defeats our purpose of ""teaching them the importance/value of investing but not letting them take money out of it""

"Hey everyone,

Roughly two years ago I found a really nice investment opportunity (guaranteed minimum 10% annual ROI over the course of 5 years) in wooden pellets through Serge Energy, a company based in Finland. 

I was a bit skeptical, so I did a ton of googling around and decided  to eventually go for it.

The amount I invested was fairly small, lets say 5k.

Over the last two years, everything has seemed fine and normal. 

My account manager calls me every couple of months (6-10) to let me know how the market prices are, considering the price of pellets started spiking due to the invasion of Ukraine.

I received a few emails with additional investment opportunities, most of them with a ROI of 12-15% per year, but it didn't really seem anything out of the ordinary considering the price of pellets had been soaring so fast that those values were still below the selling market value.

I received an invitation to a event in Helsinki, at the HQ, regarding future investment opportunities (I didn't go, but it all seemed fine).

Roughly a week ago I received a more curious email. Not from my account manager, but from two Asset Growth Executives (their title in the signature of the email).

The email basically states that they found a number of birch trees on my patch of land (the one used to produce wooden pellets) and that this is a great financial turn, since these can be turned into sheets of Veneer which will be sold for roughly 5x my initial investment and the payout of this process will be in 3 months from now. And the process of pellets will keep running, but the payout will be delayed a year.

For this to go forward, I would need to do an additional payment of roughly 40% the initial investment value (which, once again, is a fairly low value), to pay for the processing fees of the third party company who handles the wood. Serge Energy would also keep their usual 10% of the sale price of the veneer sheets.

So, in short, is this legit? 

Everything I google regarding the company comes out as being legit and I was fairly confident they were legit up until now -- since this really seems too good to be true.

"Thoughts on Brad Jacobs new industry? (Serial Compounder)

TLDR: Brad Jacobs is a serial M&amp;A guy who has built amazing businesses consolidating Waste, Equipment rentals (united rentals) and logistics (XPO). He will announce a new industry/target before year end!

Brad Jacobs (worth over 3bn) has been publicly talking about the fact that he will likely annouce a new industry/target before year end. All we know is that it will be in the industrial space. He has been all over bloomberg and news.

 The investment will likely be through his PE vehicle, Jacobs PE. But could be interesting equity investing opportunity to keep an eye on..

***As an example buying Ashtead in the UK as a peer to United Rentals was a winning idea in 2000 (up like 20x). Buying DSV as a play on logistics consolidation was also a Homerun if you bought in 2011 when Brad bought XPO.

As a reminder over the last 30 years Brad has consolidated 4 different segments and generatef massive gains. His companies include

 1) waste management in 1989 ($70bn market cap now) 
2) United Rentals (equipment leasing) in 1997 ($30bn mkt cap) 
3) XPO in 2011 in the logistics/forwarding space (combined XPO, GXO and RPO have $20bn market cap).

Source for example: https://www.freightwaves.com/news/xpos-jacobs-on-his-next-venture-wait-and-see/amp

WHAT COULD THE NEW VENTURE BE!?

The only requirements are that:

1)The industry is large and in the industrial sector
2) Fragmented with opportunity for M&amp;A and improvement of service through tech.


My initial thoughts is it could be in auto parts for example.. Like O’Reilly AutoParts. Or in some distribution space (Chemical distributors like IMCD come to mind)…

ANY ONE HAVE OTHER IDEAS? Its definitely something i’m watching closely!



Which subsector will be his last hurrah?


…….
Edit: 4th December.. Seems like ball has started to roll:

Brad Jacobs has chosen the vessel for his next act.

The man who put together the XPO freight conglomerate and then sold it off in pieces to leave behind the LTL-focused XPO, stand-alone 3PL RXO and contract logistics company GXO is leading a $1 billion investment in a company called SilverSun Technologies, which is publicly traded on the Nasdaq (NASDAQ: SSNT). Jacobs remains executive chairman of XPO (NYSE: XPO) and nonexecutive chairman of GXO (NYSE: GXO) and RXO (NYSE: RXO). 

Jacobs is making the investment through his investment vehicle, Jacobs Private Equity (JPE). According to an announcement released Monday, JPE will invest $900 million in SilverSun and a group of other investors, which includes private equity firm Sequoia Heritage, will invest the other $100 million.

The $1 billion investment is for a software company with a market capitalization that isn’t even $20 million and its existing business will be spun off into a stand-alone operation. What remains will be a publicly traded company that, as JPE said in a news release, “will become a standalone platform for significant acquisitions in an industry to be announced soon, along with the Company’s new name.”

The spinoff is expected to be completed in two to four months.

Jacobs, in earlier statements about his next move, did say he intended to be involved in a publicly traded company as he prefers public markets to private capital.



The acquisition of SilverSun appears to have strong parallels to how Jacobs got XPO rolling in 2011. He acquired Express-1 Expedited Solutions with a $150 million investment and built that into XPO. One key difference is the activities Jacobs acquired with Express-1 were in the industry that he stayed in through XPO. What SilverSun does is not relevant to his plans. 

SilverSun says on its website that it “is involved in the acquisition and build-out of technology and software companies engaged in providing best of breed management applications and professional consulting services to small and medium size businesses (SMBs) in the manufacturing, distribution and service industries.”

In that case, if there is deflation after the buyer buys it, then the buyer stands to lose principal, because he purchased it at a price higher than the face value. Is that correct?

"Hello, there's something I do not quite understand about the inner workings of money market funds.

For simplification, let's say we have MMF that only invests in US03Ms and is 100% invested. Let's say this fund basically has:
1. 33% of its funds invested in US03Ms that expire in 1 month.
2. 33% invested in US03Ms that expire in 2 months.
3. 33% invested in US03Ms that expire in 3 months.
in 1 month, the 33% invested in 1 will be recovered + coupon, and immediately reinvested into US03Ms.

In this very simple example, let's say all bonds were bought at a 3% coupon.

My question is, in which scenario could the MMF be at -1% in return after 1 month. 
I understand that in 1 month, we have a warranted 3% return from the first batch of bonds. Thus, for the MMF to be at -1% this means that the totality of the value of the assets has to decline by 4% on the month, (3-4=-1). This means that the 66% invested in the 2nd and 3rd batch of bonds, have lost value. 
One explanation could be that newly issued bonds pay a greater coupon and so those bonds held by the MMF decrease in value.
But since the MMF can hold them to expiration, why would the value of the MMF decrease?

"TLDR: if I have my TSP fund allocated mostly in the C fund, does it make sense to hold VOO in an IRA.

So I’m 35, and have monthly contributions to the TSP(Govt 401K), which makes up about 60% of my investment portfolio. 80% of future contributions are in the “C” fund. I also have a Roth and traditional IRA(former roll over), which I make irregular contributions to depending on the tax situation that year. This makes up about 30% of my portfolio, with the other 10% in cash. I recently sold my position in VOO for profit in my IRA, which makes up about 30% of my Roth. It’s is about 6% of my overall portfolio 

My question is if I hold the overwhelming majority of my portfolio in my TSP in the C fund, is that basically the same exposure as VOO? Would it be redundant to carry VOO in the Roth IRA?

"I am considering using Wealthfront Robo advisor. Wealthfront touts that their TLH pays for the 0.25% AUM fee and many have attested to that. I will be a high income earner in a high marginal tax bracket so this is appealing for me as I don't feel confident in my ability to do my own TLH.

I imagine as the years go on and my total assets increase, the AUM fee is going to hurt. As I continue to make monthly deposits into the account, I will still get the benefits of TLH indefinitely. However, the ratio of benefit from TLH to cost from AUM fee will decrease and invert at some point I would think. 

So here's my question. What would would the downside be of using Wealthfront Robo advisor for all my new deposits (which are more likely to be able to take advantage of tax loss harvesting than assets I have had for years) up until a certain threshold say 200-500K. At that point transfer all assets to Vanguard in kind so I don't pay capital gains on them.

&gt; There's no real penalty. If your transaction violates the wash-sale rule, the loss you try to take as a tax-deduction will be disallowed. The amount of the loss must be added to the purchase price of the security you bought that breached the wash-sale rule.

"High yield savings, you can't time the market, index funds, etc...

Now, these are actually great strategies -- for the last many years, during which I am guessing most of those chattering about all of this started trading or investing.

DCA works great when everything goes up consistently and you can just sit on your money.

"The point of this post is not to bash index investing, it’s just to make the argument that index investing is not the only way and it isn’t some perfectly superior one-size-fits-all answer. As a secondary point, I want to put it simply that if you believe there is only one acceptable investing style (active/passive), you are in the wrong.

The existence of passive investing strategies such as index ETFs is, imo, nothing short of a miracle for the average person. It allows folks who don’t know anything about financial markets, valuation, research, or much of anything else, to invest their money safely and successfully over a long term. Indexes, therefore, do a world of good for many people.

On the other hand, when we’re in a sub like this, the people who post and comment are mostly not average people who know nothing about financial markets. A good portion here are doing research regularly (some high-quality and some low-quality, of course) and making active investments based on that research. When they post about it, it’s common for others to come along saying “you should only buy [insert index fund]” or even worse, “you’re stupid for using a money manager”, or the openly hostile “you’re a fraud for being a money manager.” 

They often cite statistics, such as the “Boglehead” studies showing that most money managers don’t beat the market, and almost no active investors beat the market. Here’s why active investors should ignore that statistic:

1. Its methodology is deeply flawed because it can’t account for closet indexers. When I come up with 2-3 companies in every industry and I buy them in roughly equal proportions or I weigh more to bigger industries like tech, what I’m doing is known in the investment industry as **closet indexing**. Closet indexers create portfolios that will be highly correlated with index funds and bear much of the same risk-return profile. Now that’s all well and good, but it is an issue when this is classified under “active investing” and a manager is charging a fee for it. When Bogleheads say a manager like that is underperforming, it isn’t some “gotcha”, all they’re proving is that if you buy what’s essentially an index fund, and you pay a fee above the index fund’s fee, you’re going to underperform. That doesn’t prove there’s something wrong with active investing, it just proves there’s something wrong with closet indexing managers. And this isn’t some tiny portion of managers, it’s extremely common. 

So how do we avoid closet indexers? It’s pretty simple - ask about “**active share**.” Active share is the percentage of a portfolio that exactly matches its benchmark. A [series of studies](https://www.ft.com/content/10a5a37c-a96e-11e3-b87c-00144feab7de) found that most managers with high active share underperform, and most managers with low active share outperform. In other words, if you don’t diversify your portfolio but instead use Buffett’s strategy of building positions in a small number of stocks that you fully understand, you will probably outperform.

2. The statistics don’t apply where Bogleheads want to apply them. What I mean by this is, when they say “most people don’t beat the market,” even if that was true, it isn’t relevant. Whatever active management strategy is currently being discussed is the one that has to beat the market, not all strategies or most strategies. When you say to a value investor “90% of investors don’t beat the market,” they’re never going to change their mind, and they shouldn’t, because you haven’t given them a good reason to. **The question is whether most *value investors*,  (and not just people who call themselves that, by the way) beat the market.** This can be extrapolated to other strategies, of course. Do most day traders beat the market? No, not even close. But most day traders also don’t just say “I trade stock daily,” they have one specific strategy. If you don’t have data on that specific strategy, you probably don’t have relevant data to present at all. Anyone and everyone will always say “yes, but I don’t do things like most people in the statistic you just cited,” and it’s probably true. Research on investing strategies is very hard to conduct, and there definitely isn’t conclusive evidence available that tells us much about most strategies.

3. This idea that nobody can expect to outperform is also just obviously false when faced with common-sense reasoning. This isn’t coming from the same standpoints of statistics or abstract logic, but just practical thinking. If someone works in finance and knows the industry well, talks to industry friends about how their work is going, and reads 10-K’s with that unique insight in mind, you simply aren’t going to convince any reasonable person that the average investor in the market knows more about the industry than this person, because that certainly isn’t true.

None of this is to say that nobody should be investing in indexes. I’d even say *most* people should, because most people don’t want to do the research and spend the time it takes to outperform. 

All I want anyone to take from this is that there’s more than one good way to invest, and if you belittle people for active investing, you’re in the wrong.",On Index Investing and Why You Don’t Have To Do It,18nphm5,1703172269.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/18nphm5/on_index_investing_and_why_you_dont_have_to_do_it/,
"I believe Einstein once said that you either earn or pay compound interest. I don´t think I fully understood this until I read John C. Bogle´s “The Little Book of Common Sense Investing” this week.

 In this book, Bogle dissects a very simple truth, which is that most active management funds do not outperform their equivalent indexes and that you can beat \~90% of investors **by simply opting out of the game**.

Active fund managers charge fees and turnover large parts of their portfolios yearly, which leads to paying taxes. So for instance, consider that in a given year a manager that you have selected performs 11%, whilst the market performs 9%. 

Since you have to pay fees to your manager, the performance you end up getting is 11% - costs. Suppose the cost is 1.5%, you end up getting 9.5%, which just over performs the market. This would be a fairly reasonable scenario and could very well repeat itself for a number of years.

The thing is that most managers fail to outperform the market over the long term and in actuality, what you are statistically likely to end up doing is simply **pay yearly fees only to end up underperforming** the market over the long run. In this way, you end up paying compound interest.  
  
Why? Because the difference between say returns of 9% yearly and 7% yearly compounds over time and you end up getting exponentially more money if you obtain yearly returns of 9% vs returns of 7%. Conversely, you pay a hefty price for obtaining returns of 7% vs 9% yearly. 

Bogle goes on to explain how funds that outperform the market for a certain period are **statistically unlikely to do so the next** and viceversa. 

It seems that over-performers become under-performers and viceversa, each one tending to revert to the mean through time. Some funds turn out to be exceptional, but there are not many of them. They are easy to spot in hindsight but not so much so in foresight.

We cannot ignore the **implacability of the power of indexed investing** and how far simpler and superior it is to plenty if not all of the flashy and costly alternatives that demand our attention daily. Most people out there that are thinking about investing are far better off by going down the path of indexed investing. 

What is perhaps most fascinating about this strategy is that it is so compelling, that one could easily throw not billions, but t**rillions of dollars at it with considerable peace of mind**. In essence, by going long the SP500 you are going long humanity. If you believe humanity is going to prosper, the SP500 is also very likely to keep appreciating in value. If it doesn’t prosper, the SP500 depreciating won´t be much of a going concern anyway.

"Due to Boston's perfomance and recent good news I started wondering whether Boston is worth investing in now, so I did some (kinda) research and have a question for y'all.  
  
Firstly, Boston Scientific recently resolved their scandal case with LOTUS, which was because they said several years ago that their LOTUS device was the best of the best, and so on. But it later turned out that there were serious problems that were not reported, and the device had to be recalled and stopped selling.  
  
This later caused a big drop in the BSX, but they recently resolved it with a [$38M settlement](https://11thestate.com/cases/boston-scientific-shareholder-settlement), which is obviously good for them.  
  
Boston is also growing steadily over the long term and generally has good dynamics as I see.  
  
However, some say that Enovis will soon take the leading position (already pushing Boston into the top pick list).  
  
So what are your bets, will Boston continue to perform as well as it has? Does it make sense to invest in it now?",Boston Scientific Scandal Is Over - Now What?,18nnvnx,1703167760.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/18nnvnx/boston_scientific_scandal_is_over_now_what/,
"  
**What happened yesterday, and my thoughts:**  


* Yesterday, we saw the market start to do a little correction. There wasn’t much news behind the move, except for the fact that VIX options expired, and QQQ failed to break the Call resistance 0DTE at 410. This may have contributed as VIX options had been suppressing VIX till now, and the expiration reset the options positioning a little. As such, VIX moved higher rapidly from 12.5 to 14. For the most part though, this was just normal mean reversion. 
* Markets have been at all time highs, up 16% on SPX since October lows, with 90% of stocks above their 50 day moving average. The market had just become a little too stretched, and needed to breathe. 
* Note that this is of course a very small correction in the scale of the move the market has just done, and is very healthy. Moving indefinitely higher is what’s not healthy. The market has to absorb and digest that move, before moving higher again. In premarket already, we can see the market already start to pare the drop. Over the next few days we will see volume dry up a little going into the Xmas break, and there isn’t much on the economic calendar in the way of major catalysts. With lower volume, we may see markets trade flat, or we can see exacerbated moves in either direction. With little on the economic calendar, it’s hard to guess exactly which way markets will move on a day to day basis. E..g markets are up in premarket, but this can easily fade to retest 4700 at least. On the whole, markets are still stretched despite the 500 point drop on the Dow, but this isn’t to say that today will be red. I caution against making day to day predictions because people call me up if they are in any way wrong. Look, we as investors aren’t fortune tellers, especially when there’s little on the economic calendar to guide us. We can only assess the overall state of the market, to determine risk reward. As readers had noted, I had left my passive positions running (trimmed a bit) and had sold all my active/swing trades, to build cash, because I suspected a near term small correction. I didn’t put the cash into the market yesterday. The dip happened so close to the close that why would I put it in just before, when I have no idea how markets will open tomorrow, especially with little particularly in premarket in way of economic news? The correction, whilst sudden, was still small. So personally, I am waiting to see more before I put the money I had trimmed, back into the market. If it moves higher form here, which premarket points to (although premarket movement means little), I will still be happy as my passive positions make money.   


**My Trades:**  


* (Explaining trades I made in my personal portfolio. People have mentioned rightly not to share too much details about company work, so I have shared trades I was executing in my personal port instead)  

* In terms of what I did yesterday, I explained in yesterday’s post that oil was trading at the top of the downward channel that had been forming. I thought it could easily get rejected there, so I trimmed half my oil positions, and left half running. My price target on oil is 80, so I left some going to meet that, but knew that this could easily get rejected at the top of that channel, so took some out. Technical analysis suggests it can even move lower to 67 now, although you’d have to see a move higher in dollar for that to happen.   

* I also trimmed my enphase position because I was off the desk the day before. Note: I still have some running. I also have positions in FSLR and ARRY. I am bullish on solar still for next year. The reason why I sold some was because I was holding form 80. It was up a lot, and whilst interest rate cuts will help them a lot next year, it doesnt immediately change their near term earnings, which were guided last quarter to be terrible. A 62% move higher in quick time was good enough for me to take some profits here.   


————  
**TODAY’S DATA LEDE/MACRO EVENTS:**  


* **UK CBI Trades data:**
   * One of the less important metrics for the Uk, but does give some telling insight, especially because it was such a miss to the downside. Came out -32 vs forecast of -14. It’s a leading indicator of retail performance, so signals a weakening retail sector in UK. (Little impact in GBPUSD because it is a small indicator)  

* **US GDP Final Revision (Q3) - Expected to remain above 5%**  
**PCE revisions too**  
\- note: these are both revisions, and barring a big surprise, won’t move markets too much as should be confirming previous readings.   

* US Jobless Claims  
————  


**INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH**  


* Evercore says that they see a big pullback in first half of 2024, as recession “materialises”.   

* Goldman put out a piece where they compared the performance of small caps vs large caps in various markets over the last 12 months. There, they concluded that smalls have only outperformed large in emerging markets. Other than it, in Japan, Europe, US and others, they have underperformed large caps. This is something we all mostly knew anyway, since Mag7 led the rally most of the year. I suppose for those that don’t follow other markets, it’s interesting to know this was the case in other markets too.   

* Goldman put out another piece looking at average inflation across G10 economies. They estimated that across them, core inflation ran at just 2.2% over past 3 months and 1.3% in November alone.   

* Hedge funds net long positions on crude hit record low going back to 2011.   

* Fitch says they expect their next moves from the Fed, ECB and BOE to be cuts - no sh\*t Sherlock. No more hikes from here.   

* Interesting fact: Statista shows that international tourism finally reaches pre pandemic level.

**FOREX**  


* GBP was lower yesterday after soft CPI print and continued slightly lower today. Trading 1.265. Note: I hold position in GBPUSD  

* USDJPY continues doing correction as yen moves higher. This is correction after Yen sell off following BOJ dovishness. Note, can bounce off of 142.59. Then again, can not. Depends on initial jobless claims numbers as they can move the dollar.    

* AUD moving higher again.   
————— 

**MARKETS**   


* SPX: Sold off yesterday a bit back to 4700. Held that level in aftermarket, and pared losses to 4722. ( up 0.5% from lows of yesterday)  

* Nasdaq: Fell to 16,550 yesterday, pared some of those losses in premarket, up 0.7% in premarket from the lows.    

* GER40 tracked the sell off in US overnight. Was relatively flat since.   

* HKG: Opened much lower, after US sell off. Recovered 1.6% from there. Basically pushed up right from the open. Partly due to China economic stimulus measure announcements e.g. cutting deposit rate  

* OIL: Failed to break out of downward channel yesterday. Still testing it in premarket. Needs to close above 75 on daily to break out.   

* VIX: pushed up after expiration. Now at 13 handle.   

* Bond yields slightly higher today, probably as sellers take from bonds into equities.

If you guys are interested in the specifics of the trades feel free to ask, but for now to keep it short, I basically did swing trades on a handful of companies on which I did extensive due diligence in advance: namely Airbnb, Shopify, Tesla, and Nvidia. 

Now I am wondering: Should I switch the investment strategy on my ""regular"" account from passive ETF investments to swing-trading individual stocks as well?

I asked a genuine question and wanted to learn. I hope to get more insights from the more open-minded people here.

Edit: wow guys, I woke up and saw a lot of comments. I appreciate the teaching, constructive reponses a lot. Some comments are weird, some people even sent depression help through DMs. Having never been an RE investor in my life, it's OK it takes pain to learn and I'm glad I got beaten down to fully grasp the concept.

To be clear, I didn't mean RE investment is a bad thing. Nor did I mean RE should replace SP500 entirely. It's another vehicle to diversify your porfolio. I get that.

As I look for efficiency in doing anything in life, the question I should really have asked is, ""Why investing in RE is more efficient than investing in SP500?""

Right after the first few answers last night, I realized I missed a big part of leverage. I fell into the percentage yield trap and did not look under the hood.

The short answer is, **for SP500, to get a 10% return I need 100% ownership of the asset**. On the other hand, in RE, **I do not need 100% ownership of the asset for the appreciation**. If the cashflow is positive, then I should be good. To realize the gain in SP500, I can simply click the sell button, and it is harder to do so in RE.

Mathematically speaking, my equity is an increasing function over time, while the monthly payment is a decreasing function over time, **as long as I'm cashflow positive**. This is the part that puts me into thoughts. It means I have to manage risks such as keeping the job in economy turbulent, managing tenants, dealing with long-ass eviction process if I have to. But I get that, to enjoy the leverage I have to put in the work.

Again, thank you all for all the constructive responses!

Hello,

I'm seeking wisdom from the experts. Every millionaire I know owns a few rental properties. I'm not an RE investor (yet), and I'm trying to justify why I should put my liquid assets into RE, giving there are other options such as investing in SP500.

The SP500 yields more than 150% over the past 10 years with an average of 10% return a year. It also has less stress/risk to manage (a simply google or [here](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042415/what-average-annual-return-sp-500.asp))

I did a simple search for [cities with largest increase in home price](https://constructioncoverage.com/research/cities-with-the-largest-home-price-growth-last-decade) and found that unless you pick the right cities to buy homes in, you will not beat the SP500. Problem is, then you have to manage the property remotely or have your property manager do so which decreases the yield even more. Owning investment properties also comes with finding tenants at times, managing them, dealing with evictions etc.

Money invested in SP500 is liquid, which is not the case with homes.

Based on some of these facts, I'm not super convinced that putting my liquid assets into home, unless I can find homes that appreciates in value of more than 10%/year, in the right city, at the right time. Is this how people do it?

I'm sure I missed something. Please educate me!

Let's say I buy 100 shares of stock A for $50. I then sell a covered call expiring tomorrow with a strike of $52, and let's say I get a premium of $10. If the stock stays below $52, the call expires worthless and I just collect that $10 premium. If the stock goes above $52, let's say to $53, then I have to sell the 100 shares of that stock at a price of $52.   


Again, this is day 1 of me reading about this so the above could be wrong. But if it's right, why wouldn't I just do this every day? If the call expires worthless, I get the premium. If I get assigned, then I sell for slightly lower and miss out on some gains, but I'm still selling the stock for more than I bought it for. The next day, granted I have enough capital, couldn't I just buy 100 of the stock at the new price, and then repeat with a new sightly OTM covered call?

"&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to understand if my math (and logic) is correct when comparing gains on like-trades but in different account types. For reference, my investment amount will be $200,000 via TD Ameritrade/Charles Schwab, 15% tax rate, and 13.00% effective margin rate. 28 years old. Employed. Not married. No children.

&amp;#x200B;

AAPL 2023 YTD performance is \~+55.25%. Past performance is not indicative of future results, I know. According to 1stock1, between 1981 and 2022, Apple has been positive 27 of those 42 years, with the strongest being +211.90% and the weakest being +5.42%. The average of the positive years is +67.8103704%. Apple has been negative 15 of those 42 years, with the worst being -71.06% and the least being -4.17%. The average of the negative years is -29.092%. 1995 to 1997 (3 years) was Apple's longest consecutive yearly losing streak. 2009 to 2014 (6 years) was Apple's longest consecutive yearly gain streak. The average of all 42 years is +33.202381%.

&amp;#x200B;

Roth IRA contribution limit in 2024 is $7,000. Non-deductible. Tax-free at distribution in retirement. $7,000 + 30% = $9,100. Gain of $2,100

&amp;#x200B;

Cash account of $7,000 + 30% = $9,100. Gain of $2,100 - 15% (tax) = Gain of $1,785

&amp;#x200B;

I can see that in this example, the Roth IRA is the better choice as opposed to the cash account. However, the Roth IRA is limited to the $7,000 annual contribution. Any additional investing must be done in the cash account. As a result, the current optimal solution would be to contribute into the Roth IRA up to the limit and invest the remaining $193,000 in the cash account and continuing the annual contribution into the Roth IRA in following years.

&amp;#x200B;

Margin account of $7,000 + $7,000 (margin) = $14,000. $14,000 + 30% = $18,200. Gain of $4,200 - 15% (tax) = Gain of $3,570 - my cost of margin for 1 year which is (.13 \* 7000) = Gain of $3,570 - $910 (margin) = Gain of $2,660.

&amp;#x200B;

I can see that in this example, with the same $7,000, AFTER taxes AND cost of margin, the margin account is the better choice as opposed to both the cash account and the Roth IRA. Similar to the cash account, I have no annual contribution limit, can withdraw at any time, and can invest the full $200,000. With margin, this amount becomes $400,000. As a result, the current optimal solution appears to be investing the full amount of $200,000 + $200,000 in the margin account and disregarding the Roth IRA entirely.

&amp;#x200B;

While I take much greater risks investing that amount in a margin account and having the knowledge/information that the average of Apple's yearly losses is \~-30%, over the long term, it's clear on paper that the optimal strategy is to go full margin, with the honest hope that the first 2-3 years are positive. I also expect my current effective margin rate of 13.00% to decrease as rates go down. I also expect my income to increase at a reasonable pace. I'm not sure if it's worth mentioning or not but I would like to marry and have children in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, is my math (and logic) correct? Am I completely overlooking something?

I'm thinking of this as having 5 ""levels"" (even though realistically at any one point you could probably use a blend, especially of the first 4 options):  
(1) **Ultra-Low Risk Accounts:** Self-directed, investing pretty much solely in ultra-low/zero risk accounts such as FDIC-insured high-yield savings accounts, CDs, I/Muni Bonds, etc.

(2) **Self-Directed/Index-Fund Based:** Generally focused around investing in the S&amp;P, ETFs and/or mutual funds to diversify and access higher returns that are not necessarily risk free, but are still lower-risk

(3) **Robo-Advisor:** Putting money into Wealthfront, Betterment, etc. and paying an initial management fee - usually around 0.25%

(4) **Financial Advisor:** Still going self-directed and using a combination of strategies, but checking in with a financial advisor for some sort of flat fee to receive professional guidance - this would usually be focused on retirement planning, but not necessarily managing your investments for you.

(5) **Wealth Management:** Full-service professional management with fees ranging from 0.30%-1.00%; generally hands-off by the individual investor. Usually includes some sort of tax-planning service and various specialty services such as executive/equity compensation planning.

"My mom just got a settlement from a injury from work and was wondering right away how they can invest it at low risk.
CDs, ibonds are things I always heard of that are low risk.

So I talked to them about CDS and putting 200k into one, I could do 6 months at 4.1% interest rate or 11 months for 4.25% rate. However they said after that 6 or 11 months the rate drops down to like .10% so making pretty much nothing off it, make more from a basic savings account.

Are all cds like this? after the 6 or 11 month period it drops down to nothing? or should I be looking for another bank to do this?
They also said monkey market account I could do and is at a fixed rate at 1% based on putting 200k into it.

"Why do companies like $WMT $COST $AMZN and $MSFT just keep on outperforming over time?

Culture.

They are perpetual innovation machines.

Sometimes, their culture goes astray but eventually it gets fixed.

When culture goes south, the company goes south.

When it gets fixed, the company goes back to doing well.

Culture is a result of a series of excellent organizational properties.

All companies that I own that have an excellent culture (which again, is a condensation of many aspects) just continue doing well.

Those that do not, eventually turn into losers.

Take $MSFT for instance.

The stock was flat from the year 2000 to the year 2014.

Why? Because Steve Ballmer operated a culture that sucked.

High in politics, low in innovation.

People were scared to fail, so no one shared ideas.

Good news moved fast around the company. Bad news, not so much.

Then came Satya and totally transformed the culture.

$MSFT shifted to being low in politics, high in meritocracy.

High in individual courage. Courage to innovate, share ideas and fail over and over until success comes.

Decentralized operations. Bad news now move around the company just as fast as good news.

All of a sudden, the company is now an unstoppable innovation machine.

Don't believe me? Read Satya's shareholder letters.

"Hihi

I am seeking advice on why you should keep money in 401k plan vs rolling it over periodically into a Roth IRA. I was looking at some numbers and came up with this:

**ROLLING OVER ROUTE**

* Lets assume you + employer contribute 22,500 into 401k this year.
* 13,500 goes into Roth ITA after rolling it over (takes a 40% tax hit).
* At a 6% return rate over 30 years, you end up with **81.3k**


Alternatively, 

**KEEPING 401k ROUTE**

* You + employer contribute 22,500 into 401k this year.
* At a 6% return rate over 30 years, you end up with 135.5k.
* Taxed at 40% upon withdrawal, this results in **81.3k**

Since both variants result in the same amount of money after 30 years, what benefits does leaving money in 401k over Roth IRA provide? I am predicting to remain in a high tax bracket post retirement. My view is that a Roth IRA will provide you with more flexibility and higher potential growth if you were to trade with that account, such as selling options against your positions.

"As you experts know, currently your cost basis is the price you buy a stock at. If years later you sell the stock at a higher price then you have to pay capital gains tax on it. This isn't exactly fair as this doesn't account for inflation. If you hold a stock and the price doesn't go up, and then 10 years later sell it, you have lost a significant amount of money due to inflation.

It would be ideal if there was a way to adjust your cost basis vis-a-vis the inflation over that period. This would account for reduced capital gains, but also enabling a capital loss as the cost basis adjust upwards. 

 Investors would then know how they are doing vs. inflation, and have a true metric on their investments, and the government would be more motivated to deal with inflation when it occurs. Further, people we would be incentivized to invest their cash instead of leaving it on the sideline.

"How can I reconcile the following two statements?

1. The price of a stock is based on expected future profits and riskiness of those profits.

2. It is generally believed by most investors that in the long run, stock prices tend to increase.

From 1., any change in stock price is by definition a ""surprise"", because all information that is currently known should be priced in. However, 2. implies that increase in stock price should not come as a surprise. It is consistent trend that price should increase in the long run.

"I doubled my returns when the interest rates were 0% by leveraging 2x using margin loans. Those margin loans are quite expensive these days with IB at 6% rate.  It looks like I can leverage 2x easily by longing /ES future contracts and keep rolling them over before expiration. And I don't have to pay any interest for this leverage. It almost sounds too good to be true. What am I missing here? I know leverage is a double edge sword and I never exceed 2x even though you can easily leverage 18x or more with futures contracts.

"I'm not sure whether this can be answered, but here goes anyway.  My wife has an ESPP for the first time.  Her first six-month purchase period concludes this Friday, 12/29, and then the shares will be automatically purchased that day (managed by Fidelity).  The company's stock price tends to bounce up and down a lot, but as of today, it is up 7% versus the beginning of the purchase period.  The shares will be purchased with a 15% discount on the share price at the beginning of the six months since that price is the lower of the beginning and end of the six months (unless there is a big drop this week, of course).  So we should make a nice profit beyond the 15% assuming there is no major drop.

There is no mandatory holding period for the shares purchased.  Because the stock price does bounce up and down pretty substantially from day-to-day, I would like to go ahead and sell on Friday if the price is up.  Is that even possible?  Would Fidelity process the stock purchase quickly enough for us to be able to go ahead and sell almost instantly on the same day?

"I always had this logic if I invest long enough into Reits I would be able to retire with dividends wiithout withdrawing.

Lots of people say once snowball begins you really feel the power of dividends.

I have another 35 years before retirement anyway and residency is UK but more and more doing calculations of profit after each year finish I realise dividends is like fake hope. For example first year my dividends payout was £16.43. This year is £900 range and next year projected £1400 which seems good on paper but these very dividends stock could have been replaced with growth and instead of small realized gains I would of had way more unrealised gains.

But more on reits there is even research that Reits most years outperform SP500 due to the power of reinvesting dividends but after holding
Vici (risk but growth) Realty Income (passive but monthly dividend and super diversified) I realised they are both very passive boring stocks both together are 15% of my portfolio.

Of course during high interest rates you wouldnt expect Reits to be exciting but I just did future conservative calculations and slightly doubt whether its even worth holding Reits. Posting here whether I missed something from my calculations that makes it so one sided

Like the way I see snowball effect is when it's growth is  exponential and I thought if for example Realty Income pays you £45 per month that would be enough to buy 1 whole share right  so calculations are you need 264 shares which is £11,880


Year 1

7.2% growth

But if invested in growth stock 
11,880 +20%
1 year =14,256


So I thought snowball effect doesn't really happen with 11k into Reits but what if I was able to buy 4 Realty Income shares every month is that snowball effect?


£57,000 = 1266 shares

Only reason I chose Realty Income is because it's extremely safe stable diversified stock pays 5% but even with 60k invested I still don't see snowball effect of course everyone says just put it into VUSA and forget but dividend investors talk about how they can outperform sp500 but I don't see whether its even worth trying 

Maybe in your last 5 years employed you start exchanging your growth stocks and ETFs for Reits for passive Income but slowly I realized recently, investing into passive dividend stocks while young is a big waste of time and illusion to provide passive Income that isn't there. You can compare year 1 dividends received to current year and say wow snowball effect is real but when you take into consideration on how much growth you missed out. Makes me feel my investing strategy has been used 30 years too early 

Even when my portfolio consist of 55% Apple &amp; MSFT just mistakes like TROW DIS SOFI my portfolio every year for 5 years is 3-7% lower than VUSA. Even though stock picking is fun but it really is true VUSA seems the only hassle-stress free strategy. Don't need to readjust anything, don't need to check earnings and new competitors or sales it's so simple. Anyone else had these realizations and just want to sell everything and buy VUSA and relax with DRIP? Or do you keep believing

I’ve done a bunch of research, but I have a hard time making decisions regarding which funds, what percentage, etc. I know I want balanced risk, and I want it to be index funds if possible, and diversified well. Nothing fancy. (For context, I'm in my 30s. have good savings, have a 401k at work, and some ibonds and CDs, in addition to this.)

I spoke with a Fidelity advisor. He showed me the ETF Portfolio Builder tool that they have on their site, and recommended I use it. Using the tool, I put in the amount I’m investing, which at this time is the full $6,500, since I didn’t do it earlier in the year. For investment objective, I selected “Growth”. You can then choose a “Model Type”, which is “Fidelity-only”, or “ iShares &amp; Fidelity”.

Initially, I selected the Fidelity-only model. I’m attaching a screenshot of their breakdown recommendation. [Screenshot 1](https://imgur.com/eEdYjxi) and [screenshot 2](https://imgur.com/epQEMTQ).

XBM / XMA exposure - diversified metals and mining, copper, aluminum, gold, silver, forest products, steel. 

COW exposure - general ag, fertilizers, industrials, ag finance 

XEG - Canadian oil and gas 

————————————————

Questions are, 

* Will these choices together give me the broadest commodity exposure possible with ETF investing in CAD dollars. 

* Am I missing any other obvious choices ? Or will these together encapsulate the most broad market commodity trends ? 

* Due to the high number of gold mining exposure that 2 of these ETFs posses will it give me the same result as investing in gold as a inflation and market crash hedge.  

* What are the differences between investing in a gold mining company vs. the actual physical asset itself such as GLD etf. I assume they are highly correlated ?

"I am 33.  I have been operating a business the past 6 years and have about $500k in a high-yield savings account.  I held more cash than I think I would have liked to because I wanted to reinvest in the business and potentially try some new ideas.

&amp;#x200B;

Nonetheless I am sitting on post-tax cash of $500k.  I already have $335k in 401(k) with 100% in VTI.  Although the Marcus high yield savings is great I feel like I am sitting on way too much cash. Ideally I want to hold at least $150k so I have runway for business for the next year or two.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously all of us wish we had thrown a large brick of cash into tech stocks, etc. at the end of 2022 - trying not to let that sting but it definitely is hard feeling like I could have just thrown money into stocks and not had to work so hard building a business - hindsight bias is a bitch lol.  I am grateful to be in this position but still feel like I have totally missed the boat.

&amp;#x200B;

I am thinking about putting like $300k into Google, Amazon and Microsoft because I feel that cloud computing and AI are only going to become more popular.  I use AWS a lot and see almost all of my clients using AWS.  Also maybe Apple just because they have a really good moat.

&amp;#x200B;

Bottom line is should I just throw excess capital into tech stocks, put it all in VTI or do something else?  I calculate if I just do VTI and chill it will be worth like $5M later but I am like...AI is going to change earth, needs significant compute from the cloud and even though I missed the 2023 runup in tech it feels like there is still a lot of growth left.  My goal is to get as rich as possible as young as possible, ideally without having to wait to 59.5 years old to withdraw.

"Especially interested to hear from the managers who missed their bogie and the reasons why?

Me, with a few days left in the year have underperformed the S&amp;P by about 10 basis points.  I was down bad early in the year based on a large underweight to the magnificent seven and a large merger arbitrage bet that went sour.  I was also in an out of the benchmark position in pimco California municipal bond cefs which took a hit when Pimco out of nowhere cut distributions and prices tanked.  

I made a lot of changes to my portfolio this year eliminating all bonds and going 100% stocks as this is a taxable account.  I put all the bonds in my IRAs.  

I was also heavily overweighted to dividend stocks at the beginning of the year which contributed to my underperformance.  I dumped some of those and lowered allocations to others which allowed me to substantially increase my allocation to tech and the mag 7.  I still am underweight the mag 7, especially apple but am overweight certain software stocks and semiconductor stocks.   Making these changes allowed me to catch up to the index by the end of the year after being down close to 600 basis points at the halfway point.","Active Managers of r/investing...did you beat your bogie this year?

"I'm an investor from Europe, currently diversified into BET (Romania) and SXR8 (S&amp;P500), exploring further diversification options. While I appreciate the stability and growth potential in my current portfolio, there are some concerns I'd like your opinions on.

For the US (SXR8), my concerns are about the aging population potentially impacting the consumer base and workforce, political instability, and the looming US-China tensions in the Pacific. However, the US's leadership in tech and AI innovation is a strong positive.

In Romania (BET), much like the rest of Europe, there's been a surge in support for fringe parties. While political and fiscal challenges persist, Romania's potential entry into Schengen in the next few years could significantly boost the economy. The war in Ukraine presents risks and opportunities, especially in terms of post-war reconstruction.

"Hey everyone! Firstly I’d like to wish everyone a Merry Christmas! Secondly I would like to ask a financial question. So currently my work has an Employee Stock Purchasing Plan with a 15% match, and as a result I have been consistently contributing into that. I have recently moved my shares into my own private Fidelity brokerage account. I’m a young college student so it is not an insane amount of money, but it is about $4,500 so it’s still a significant amount to me at this stage of my life. My question is whether I should keep the stocks or reallocate them? 
I was always told to not have “all your eggs in one basket” so having the money all in one stock (it’s a blue retail company) doesn’t seem like the best strategy to me. I’ve thought about it and I could sell my shares and by a ETF like VOO or VTI, I could buy a company with a higher dividend, or I could put the money into a Roth-IRA. 

I’m at the pivotal moment of graduating next semester, so while I know that the Roth is probably the best call for me long term I know that I cannot withdrawal for a substantial time. It would nice to be able to have access to the funds in the case of an emergency and I suppose that I could put it in a HYSA, however I know that the market growth in average is much higher.

Additionally I’m not sure if selling is the best idea because I know I’ll have to pay taxes on the gains, but I’ll be honest I’m not entirely sure about the specifics of that.

Hey r/investing community,  
I've been looking into GrafTech International (EAF) as a potential investment opportunity, and I wanted to gather some opposing viewpoints before making a final decision. I believe it's important to have a well-rounded understanding of a stock and consider various perspectives.  
Here's some data I've gathered so far:  
\- In Q3 2023, big funds like Yacktman Asset Management and First Eagle Investment Management [bought into the stock, indicating a positive sentiment.](https://www.dataroma.com/m/activity.php?sym=EAF&amp;typ=a)  
\- However, EAF's current price of $2.11 is significantly lower than the average holding price of these [funds ($3.83), suggesting a potential margin of safety](https://www.dataroma.com/m/activity.php?sym=EAF&amp;typ=a).  
Now let's evaluate GrafTech International based on some risk checks:  
1. Financial Position: Interest payments are not well covered by earnings.  
2. Profit Margins: Profit margins have decreased from 33.9% to 1.7% compared to last year. (Which is concerning)  
3. Revenue and Earnings Forecast: Analysts forecast an average earnings growth of 99.8% per year for the next 3 years.  
4. Profitability: The company is currently profitable.  
Considering the above factors, it seems that GrafTech International has its strengths and weaknesses. However, I would like to hear from the community and get your insights on the potential downsides and risks associated with this investment. 

I am building my whole investment thesis on this company around thinking that if there are already some big funds in it, they might be up to something. Seeing that funds like Yacktman Asset Management and First Eagle Investment Management have bought into GrafTech International (EAF) in Q3 2023, it certainly raises my curiosity and confidence in the stock.

Tldr: will have just enough next year to make a down payment for a house, uncertain if that's the smart decision, or if it's best to save further so net value doesn't go to near zero. 

44M, wife and a 5yr old son, living in a rented house in Europe (Portugal). Net worth around 80k euros, 70k in the market (100% stocks), the rest in a bank account, for day to day + any unexpected needs.

While maintaining our standards of life, I expect to be able to add around 35k to investment account in 2024, and between 15 to 20k a year from 2025 onwards (I will take a sort of pay cut in 2025 as some temporary tax breaks will end). 

Life Goals:
	- Buy a house in Lisbon (to live in now, and leave it to my son in the future) 
	- Buy a house in Madeira (to live in after retirement) 
	- Retire around 60-65
	
Currently losing sleep over the following:
Get to 100k euros and make a down payment for an apartment in Lisbon in mid 2024
 OR 
stay invested and living in a rental until reaching 200k euros (in 4 years or less, hopefully), and then take 100k out to make the down payment?

I am dreading having to start the investments from zero again. Bought my first stock in 2020, made huge mistakes in 2021 and 22 (didn't sell , rode from the top all the way down until near oblivion, bought options, took out personal credit, etc) and then gained some sense in 2023, and will end this year at around +30%. Also, I'm now 100% debt free.

On the other hand, the market taking another downturn is scary as well, even though I'm convinced we'll have years of positive returns ahead of us, with the interest rates going down (which should also help with more accessible housing prices...) 

Anyone facing similar dilemma? In general, is it smart to get out of the market and essentially start over when you reach just enough for a goal of yours, or stay in until there's still some capital left to grow?

**Analysis: Looking at Dollar &amp; Small Caps:**  
**DOLLAR:**  


* DXY is now down 3% since the Dec 13th Fed meeting, and 5% down since November, on rate cut optimism. Let’s look at what the data is telling us about what traders are expecting going forward now. 
* If we compare the CDX to DXY, we can see that Corporate bond traders expect the dollar to continue to fall from here. (See the analog below. DXY tends to track CDX)
   * [https://imgur.com/a/fYBFuvz](https://imgur.com/a/fYBFuvz)
* The bloomberg risk reversal index also just hit the low of the year. This also tells us that the dollar is expected to remain under pressure. 
   * [https://imgur.com/a/jSD1jAr](https://imgur.com/a/jSD1jAr)   
* Conclusion: Dollar to remain under pressure. This is positive for the equity markets. A falling dollar should continue to support equity markets higher.   


**Small Caps:**  


* Since October, Small caps have rallied as investors rotate out of Mag 7. 
* If we track the IWM against SPY (Small caps vs Big caps), we can see that the IWM is testing the resistance of a medium term downtrend. 
   * [https://imgur.com/a/bHZH7J2](https://imgur.com/a/bHZH7J2)   
* What this tells us is that we could see some short term correction in small cap stocks, many of which have rallied significantly. 
* This is what the Skew Data is telling us too. IV in OTM call options has reduced, and there is a gamma resistance at 105 on IWM. 
* All of this tells us that we could see some price correction in IWM soon.
* However, long term the momentum is still strong for small caps. Flows into corporate bonds remain supportive.

**What happened yesterday and what are my thoughts on it?**  


* Boxing Day is historically the 2nd best trading day of the year, with average returns of 0.5%. Yesterday’s returns was 0.42%.
* SPX opened around 4761, before moving higher. Intraday, it moved above the 4775 level, which has formed a resistance throughout last week. Couldn't break notably above it, so will continue to watch this level today. This was likely due to lack of data and volume in the market. Ultimately, sellers were sitting at this level. 
* The drop in dollar as well as seasonal boost is what supported market yesterday. 
* Oil outperformed on falling dollar and as US bought 3 million barrels for their strategic reserve. 
* Nio popped after unveiling new sedan, whilst Intel dragged other semis higher after securing funding for new project in Israel  


**——— INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH ———**   


* ANZ - USDJPY will eventually move lower to 136 by the end of 2024
* ANZ sees AUD/USD at 0.68 in Q1 and 0.7 in Q4. Driven by USD drop and developments in China. RBA will only cut at end of 2024, whilst Fed would start cutting before. Also risk positive sentiment. 
* BBH says they expect Dollar to remain under pressure this week. Lack of any major data to slow downward momentum. 
* BCA research compared historic relationship between bank lending standards and commercial and industrial loans. Suggested that history tells us commercial and industrial loans will be down 10% by H2 2024. Said this only happens in recessions.

* Theyre not in a rush and don’t face risks of falling behind the curve. 
* Want to see wage talk outcomes next spring.
* ALL OF THIS IS QUITE DOVISH. IT SHOWS CLEAR INTENT TO DELAY ANY TIGHTENING. THIS PUSHED JPY LOWER.

"Hi all - kind of a silly question here but I was thinking, one of the allures of sports betting is that you can have a realistic shot (say a 40% chance) of doubling your money in one night if you pick a game right.

Investing in the S&amp;P 500 for example gives you a much better chance at doubling your money but it might take ~10 years.  

Is there a way to essentially “gamble” in the market on a short term time basis where the upside is potentially doubling your money, the outcome of your “bet” is realized much more quickly and you have say at least a 40% chance of “winning”?

Ive contributed a bit to 401k this year, it's negligible at the moment but there is match. Do we start maxing out Roth IRA?

Our total debts/bills equal about $5,500 monthly. $2500 Mortgage, $3 000 total with Utilities etc. 2 Car Payments equal to $900 &amp; then additional house hold payments/ expenses. Debt is minimal, about 12k on a debt consolidation &amp; 4k on a low interest Platinum Credit Card (8%)

We reliably bring home $11,000-$11,500 monthly. We are in the 1st half of our 30's. I'm also in a profession where I have an advantage in purchasing Real Estate &amp; want to make my first investor purchase this year if possible.

"Hello everyone,

Four years back, I got ""lured"" into doing some insurance(?) at MetLife where I invest 400$ a month and they manage this, some kind of investment, not entirely sure of the details as I don't have the policy right in front of me.

I have had regular yearly meetings with representatives discussing details, perforamnce, etc.

Last year, when they showed me the performance it was like -10% or so.

Now, after started investing there it sparked my interest so I did some reading and created a portfolio of my own (not huge, but of about 50k$) and managed to get a return of 114.7% to date (i.e. roughly 2 years). I have mostly been doing swing trading in the TechStock market as I work in the field of IT.

That being said, understanding more or less how the markets work, it seems that investing in an ETF myself would be way better than MetLife handling any of my money (not only do they manage to underpofrm against the market, but also take some fee).

The money I put there are solely for my kids so I don't really want to do any kind of trading with them as I have a long period span of 18+ years to invest and wait.

  
**TLDR**: Started inveting in MetLife, they seem to underpform disasterously and I think to start investing into an ETF myself as I have gained some experience the past few years.

"Hello all,

I've got a rental house that I've had for a couple years which on paper is an amazing investment.

Sadly although I have a management company running it it is far more psychologically trying than I originally thought. Surprisingly renting your house that you once loved to a terrible person that calls it a shit hole and complains about everything takes a toll emotionally even if you don't have to deal with it. Your mind always goes back to the house which is something I did not anticipate 

If I cashed out I'd get about 100k in proceeds. What would be a good investment for this money? I'd really like something that prioritizes an income generating component over growth. I know if I put it away in a mutual fund until I retire it will be worth a lot more. What I am learning in life though is that ""golden years"" aren't that golden and the government will take everything anyway when you can't afford a shit nursing home bed for $5k a month and you have to go on welfare.

* 10-year treasury has a lot of room to come down in 2024. Brings down mortgage rates. This means being invested in groups that are sensitive to falling interest rates (e.g. interest rates and financials) and improving housing
* Number one large cap sector pick: financials, industrials, and technology
* Capex recovery next year because surveys show everyone was too cautious this year
* Back-end loaded year in 2024. More money made in second half. Base case is the S&amp;P is flat or down 5% in the first half. There's likely going to be a growth scare in the first half (anxiety from the start of rate hikes)

I'm trying to calculate whether it's worth selling in this scenario.

Would a X%-15% difference on the current gain be OVER or UNDER the growth (assumed) difference between asset B and asset A?

"Hi all! So I wanted to start trying to understand how options work so I bought 1 contract. Turns out that's not a good way to go about understanding it. Anyway, looking for advice on what to do and what choices I have. I tried googling but am having trouble understanding and getting the answers I'm looking for.


Here are some of the facts as I know them:

 
In July 2023 I bought 1 contract of 100 shares for $100 (so $1 a share). At the time, the price per share was around $35.

What I had bought is a ""call"" contract with the strike price being $80 (breakeven $81 per robinhood) with the expiration on Jan 19th 2024.  


By some miracle, the stock is now $83 a share. 

Given that the expiration is close (and it looks like I'm making money now) I'm unsure what to do or how to move forward.  My understanding is I can even act on some of those choices now? And that my options are to ""sell"" or ""exercise"". I'm having trouble understanding what each of these mean. 


Please correct me if I'm wrong!! 

So far, I THINK ""sell"" is just sell the contract for what it's worth currently to someone else that believes it will do even better by the date.

 I think ""exercise"" means that I can make the contract give me the 100 shares without paying any extra (because i bought the 100 shares for $100 in the contract?) because it is at/above the strike price of $80. I am very nervous that if I click ""exercise"" that i will be signing up to buy 100 shares at the $80 price, thus spending $8000 in addition to the $100 i spent buying the contract. Also, if the stock was selling below $80, my understanding is I wouldn't be given the option to ""exercise"".

"In August this year BD shared the news that the new and improved Alaris Infusion System got the green light from the FDA with a 510(k) clearance. And also just recently they resolved a previous scandal involving Alaris.

So, the story started when in 2020, BD caused a stir by lowering its forecast, attributing it to efforts to improve and expected lower sales of the Alaris. They also mentioned that fixing the Alaris software would involve more paperwork, and existing customers could still use the system for medical needs. 

Additionally, Becton disclosed a $59 million charge related to recalling specific Alaris pumps voluntarily. After that they were hit with the lawsuit and now they are paying a fairly large [settlement for this](https://11thestate.com/cases/bdx-shareholder-settlement).

"There was a recent post about VanEck Morningstar Wide Moat ETF (BATS: $MOAT) from u/Big_Forever5759. I decided to check out the underlying index, and compare it to the S&amp;P 500.  
  
Since the end of March 2009, the index has returned an annualized 15.21% per annum. This slightly outperforms the S&amp;P 500 at 14.96% per year.

"Hi and thank you for your interest in my post.

As the title mentions, I recently opened a Roth IRA using Vanguard. I have been investing in VTSAX for several years with Vanguard, with a single brokerage account, which I am now learning is a (correct me if I'm wrong) taxable brokerage account. 

With the newly opened Roth IRA I had the option of contributing to it using the funds from my original brokerage account, but I did a little research before submitting, it seems like that would be a mistake. If I'm understanding this correctly, this would mean Vanguard will sell my funds to supplement the transaction to my Roth IRA. Is this what is called a wash sale? Would it be more optimal to supplement the Roth Ira with my current yearly earnings?

"Hi all,

  
Had a quick question that I wanted to run by the group. I've been building together a checklist for evaluating new stocks and one metric that I've been mulling over the last few days is Return on Net Tangible Assets (RONTA). There isn't a whole lot of coverage on this metric and when there is, the equations differ (some just take out intangible assets and goodwill from total assets and subtract from total liabilities, while others also take out interest bearing liabilities).

  
Does anyone look at this metric when evaluating new companies? While obviously you would need to benchmark this % against comparable companies/industries, I'm having a hard time interpreting it in the sense that the metric doesn't seem really useful for tech companies where goodwill/intangibles are a large % of total assets and would thus have an inflated percentage. Maybe it would be useful just for financial/manufacturing/etc. companies?

  
Also, when I look at a company like $DGX who is in healthcare, their RONTA % is 30-40%, which seems pretty good, but then I'm not sure it makes sense to take out goodwill since they have been growing mostly through acquisitions. So, would ROA % be better for them?

  
I guess I'm looking at ROA %, Operating ROA % (using EBIT) and RONTA % and wondering how and when I should be using each metric for company evaluation.",Return on Net Tangible Assets Usage,18sdt8z,1703717791.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/18sdt8z/return_on_net_tangible_assets_usage/,

I chose the appropriate target date fund offered by vanguard, 2055 out of convenience and not knowing any better. Since then I’ve been learning a bit more and I’ve somewhat adapted the boglehead mindset. I’m 100% VT in my Roth IRA. 

Lately I’ve been considering moving my funds out of the TDF because I’d like to be a bit more aggressive since I have 30-35 years before I retire (I don’t love the 10% bond allocation). My plan doesn’t give me alot of options and I’ve narrowed it down to 2 funds that I’m considering. These are the vanguard institutional 500 index trust (sp500 from what I can gather) and VPMAX. Other funds available to me include AVFIX, RICGX, HWMIX, VHCAX, VEXRX, VMCIX and VSCIX. I do not see a VT equivalent option available to me. 

There’s also an option in vanguard to manage my portfolio on my own and fine tune it to vanguards recommended allocations. Their recommend allocations are as follows

RICGX 12%
TDF2055 35%
Vanguard institutional 500index 14%
Vanguard institutional International Stock Index 22%
VMCIX 17%

I’m leaning towards 500 index trust because the ER is 0.01% compared to the 0.07% on my TDF and the much higher ER of 0.31% of VPMAX. Also, although VPMAX seems to have outperformed the SP500 since inception, the difference might be outweighed by that higher ER. I’m also considering the vanguard recommended allocations I listed above, seems a bit more diverse. Any other funds I should be considering? 

Any thoughts or insight would be appreciated. I’m still learning and want to make a good decision.

"As the title says. After some deliberation, I have altered my default pension, a huge step I know. I'm not sure how that kind of thing is received on this sub, being only a very occasional visitor myself. On one hand I know you guys are experienced, even so, tampering with the pension feels like a massive step, even feeling relatively confident myself..

For background, my pension is with Aegon, 5% matched salary with my employer and i'm in the UK. I did the above for 2 reasons; firstly, it was horribly overweighted in bonds, too much for my liking at 32 years old. And I have the risk apetite to go equity heavy until a little later down the line. Secondly, it was a mixture of actively managed funds, this didn't have my confidence as from what i've read, the proportion of active managed beating index trackers over the long run are extremely low.

My new portfolio therefore looks like this: (apologies, I dont have the tikr and i'm too lazy to hunt at the moment)

Vanguard ESG developed world all-cap Index @86.6%

Vanguard ESG Emerging Markets index @10%

Vanguard global bond index fund hedged @3%

Cash (for account fees) @0.4%

My reasoning as I began touching on above is that I didnt like actively managed or bond heavy. Even Ray Dalio with his all weather fund has came out in recent times of high inflation and said that bonds are money losers in this climate. So an equity heavy bastardised 3 fund portfolio giving global diversification is what i've rested on.

Thoughts? Do you feel i'm over diversified? Would you include other asset classes or reweight the portfolio? Or do you feel i'd benefit more from another global equity for cheaper ongoing charges? I do realise the ESGs are approx 0.2% as opposed to other Vanguard funds. I do have other investment options outside of Vanguard, but most aren't as cheap. I feel this could be the fund or nearly the fund to carry my through the next 30 years, woth gradual reweighting in favour of bonds.

Roughly 17k just sitting in a savings account that I continue to add maybe 500 a month. Is there something beneficial I can be doing with that money that’s safe and short term. I’d imagine in 4 years I’ll use it for the house. But with inflation I feel like it’s just losing value. Im not smart enough to start choosing stocks but is there like an auto invest kind of account that can gain interest like the target fund date? Thanks for the direction

"I'm about to start working a 70k, W2 salary job, and will be making another 10-20k as a independent contractor under a LLC. My company will match me 2% max of my salary(or 25% of my contributions, whichever is lesser) for a 401k, so $5,600 a year is the max I want to contribute right now just to get the full match. 

I'll also be hopefully maxing my IRA, and will be choosing a HSA plan which I am 100% maxing out. 

My logic is to max out everything besides the 401k for the tax deductions and run any business expenses that qualify under my LLC to be as ""poor on paper"" as possible.

I plan to buy investment property of 80k-150k this year and just want to show the bare minimum taxable income I need to qualify for a mortgage.

My current portfolio is as follows:

* US Large Cap 40%
* International 20%
* US Mid cap 10%
* US Small Cap 10%
* Tax free municipals 5%
* other bonds 5%
* JEPI/Hedge funds 10%

My protfolio has had great returns recently, so I wanted to replicate it, but after researching this site, it appears VT + BND is basicall all I need? Also, I don't see hedge funds as an option on vangaurd, or an S&amp;P weighted, or other funds I'm currently invested it, so it is hard to replicate in vangaurd.

"Hi everyone,

So I was at my wife’s college reunion the other day and it was at her friend’s parent’s house. Needless to say I was blown away. It was easily 20,000 ft.², in the best part of town and clearly no expense was spared. The father is also building his daughter an 11,000 ft.² house down the road.

Why am I mentioning any of this? I asked my wife how he made his money and from what she knows, he sold his family-owned golf course for $9.4 million in 2006 and then bought three car washes (that also house car detailing and mechanic services) and has been on the up and up ever since. Factor in taxes etc and that would not come close to covering the cost of his lifestyle- trust me. Building the house easily cost $9m. With the exception of the golf course which his father picked up back in the day for peanuts, he and his family literally came from nothing, 900 sq ft housing a family of six- very blue collar. I realize that $9.4 million is an enormous amount of money but this guy lives like a guy worth $50m +. 

They travel only by private jet, stay in only five star hotels, and appear to have a bottomless pit of money. You get the idea.

Some quick math:

20,000 ft.² X 600 per sq ft = $12m built in 2015 (he paid cash for everything including purchase price)

11,000 ft.² X 600 per Sq ft = $6.6m in progress.

(He managed the construction of both houses and subbed everything out, so the cost was possibly substantially less than above figures)

$500k annual household budget (estimate)

Are there any car wash owners here or business owners who could offer their two cents on this enormous compounding of capital? Could this guy earn millions for himself every year from car washes? I looked up the company online and it says their revenues are $6.8 million. He could have invested everything in Facebook for all I know but from the background check I did it online looks like the car washes are his main assets. 

I know it’s very limited information. I can try to provide more information if I can. Thanks in advance",Car Wash Mogul- Enormous ROI,18t5xu9,1703801045.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/18t5xu9/car_wash_mogul_enormous_roi/,
"Anavex Life Sciences (AVXL) is developing a novel Alzheimer's drug called **Blarcamesine**. The company has made significant strides in the clinical development and is now seeking regulatory approval.  
  
**EU Approval**  
  
In November 2023, Anavex submitted a full approval application for Blarcamesine to the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The EMA has recommended that Anavex proceed with this application earlier this month.  
  
The EU approval process is typically slower than the U.S. FDA approval process. However, the EMA has the potential to fast-track Blarcamesine due to its promising efficacy and safety profile.  
  
**U.S. FDA Approval**  
  
Anavex is also seeking accelerated approval for Blarcamesine from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Accelerated approval is granted to drugs that show a positive effect on a surrogate biomarker, such as amyloid plaques or tau protein levels.  
  
In September 2023, Anavex announced that Blarcamesine had lowered the levels of amyloid plaques in the brain. The company also found that Blarcamesine slowed the loss of brain volume. Both findings were statistically significant.  
  
The FDA has granted accelerated approval to other Alzheimer's drugs based on biomarker data alone. Therefore, it is possible that the FDA could grant accelerated approval to Blarcamesine.  
  
**Timeline**  
  
Anavex has not set a specific release date for Blarcamesine. However, the company has indicated it expects the drug could be approved in 2024. Here is a possible timeline for Blarcamesine approval:  
  
**EU Approval: Early 2024**  
**U.S. FDA Accelerated Approval: Spring or summer 2024**  
**U.S. FDA Regular Approval: Late 2024 or early 2025**  
  
**Conclusion**  
  
Anavex's Alzheimer's drug has the potential to be a major breakthrough in the treatment of this debilitating disease. The company is making progress in the clinical development and regulatory approval process. If all goes well Blarcamesine could be available to patients in 2024 🤞🤞🤞  
  
**Additional Considerations**  
  
Blarcamesine seems to be more effective than Leqembi, the only other Alzheimer's drug approved in the past decade (developed by Biogen). Blarcamesine seems to be much safer than Leqembi, since there have been no deaths caused by Blarcamesine.

The state offers a healthy pension that will give a great monthly income into retirement, but I like to prepare as if that pension (as well as social security) won't be there when I retire in 30+ years.

I have both a 403b (current balance is around $15K) and a Roth IRA (current balance of $80,000). Additionally, I've got a single account with $140,000, plus miscellaneous savings/checking accounts. 

I've been maxing out my Roth IRA since I was 19, and I picked up the 403b when I started my job, just putting a hundred bucks or so into it each month.

My question: should I be shifting more money into my 403b vs. the Roth IRA? I struggle with balancing saving for the future while also allowing myself to live today, so I'd like to keep my total monthly investments roughly where they are (around $700 or $800 per month).

"I am Just getting started on self-investing and I would like to include international exposure to my portfolio because of diversification and return benefits. However, I don't know if the tax implications would outweigh the possible benefits.  
Based on what I have read, in a taxable account, foreign tax withholding is offset by a tax credit, but international ETFs often have more non-qualified dividends which are taxed at the income tax rate. However in a tax-advantaged account, the dividends don't matter but the foreign tax cannot be recovered/offset.  
Given these tax drags, does it make sense to invest internationally at all? I guess for lower-income investors whose income tax rates are low wouldn't be too affected by ordinary dividends in a taxable account. What about for mid to high income investors?

"What Happened
Headlines yesterday were championed by the largest copyright lawsuit in the Manhattan Federal Court: The New York Times sues Microsoft and OpenAI. The copyright infringement lawsuit against the companies says that both used the newspaper’s content to train their models without permission. In doing so, the companies jeopardized Time’s business in its entirety. The Times also suggested in the filing that both companies should be liable for BILLIONS of damages. What prompted the lawsuit? Failed negotiations between the involved parties over the usage of Times material. They also stated they were worried about AI attributing false information to the newspaper. I guess when money is on the line news outlets decide to worry about whether their information is accurate or not. Now here is the real kicker - the Times is calling for both OpenAI and Microsoft to destroy all chatbots that use Times material. With OpenAI’s valuation, currently over $80 bn, coming almost completely from ChatGPT, this could compromise the integrity of the entire company. 

The Simple Sides (My) Take
The bad news is that I am not a legal professional and truly have no idea how this will go. While I do hold my own opinions, I have reached out to multiple lawyers to get more professional opinions and will be sure to add them here when they respond. In the meantime let’s jump into a couple of completely feasible outcomes. 

The entire lawsuit is kaput: a.k.a, insignificant or thrown out 
To me, this lawsuit is somewhat of a joke: “Newspaper upset that companies use articles available online.” I honestly DO NOT think the lawsuit will amount to much. It seems like journalists at the Times are worried that they are going to lose money and jobs to AI and aren’t happy about it - rightfully so. However, being scared and upset about AI replacing you isn’t a good reason to cry out to the long arm of the law. When the case gets underway it will be interesting to see the arguments presented by the legal team for the Times. 

The New York Times wins the lawsuit
If the Times wins the lawsuit it could be a major step in journalism’s fight against AI. Not only would the victory set a legal precedent for future AI copyright cases, but it would mean significant damages being paid to the Times. They (the Times) could come into billions of dollars, possibly boosting the stock (ticker: NYT) to 52-week highs. This could also lead to a revaluation of the AI industry. If websites can “charge” for AI models training on their information, the profitability scales might shift. The more content you have online the more you could capitalize on AI models. AI companies are also not heavily regulated at the moment. A win for the Times could shift lawmakers’ attention to the growing market sector.

Microsoft and OpenAI win the lawsuit 
Similar to if the Times won, there would be a legal precedent set - AI models can be trained on any information. This could also reinforce the current AI industry and lead to possible growth in valuations for AI-invested stocks. The New York Times would also likely experience some negative effects, possibly paying lawyer fees for both defendants. In layman’s terms, Microsoft stock would be soaring up and the New York Times would be diving down. 

Stock Movements Based on Lawsuit Outcomes
We see the MSFT and NYT stocks moving in all sorts of directions depending on the outcome of the pending lawsuit. No need to worry, you’re reading The Simple Side, so we’re gonna break it down for you. If nothing happens and the lawsuit is thrown out then Microsoft might suffer some residual damage from the negative headlines, but the stock price will remain relatively steady. If the New York Times wins then its stock will likely jump up probably both in the short and mid-term, but Microsoft will likely have a significant short-term drop. If Microsoft wins then its stock will jump in both the short and mid-to-long-term, whereas the Times stock will drop in the short term and likely recover within the mid-term.

Could capitalize using options trade strategies. I wrote a full article about this and the profitability of the trades but out of respect for the “no promotion” sub guidelines I can’t post links.

"I'm wondering if anyone can shed light on this.

So I understand ETF's have expense ratios that are expressed as a percentage, and I understand that is the expense the ETF provider charges annually. I also understand that this expense is fractionally deducted from the fund's Net Asset Value daily. However, I don't understand how the NAV is consolidated with the share price.

For example, QQQ and QQQM follow the exact same basket of stocks (NASDAQ 100) but one has an expense ratio of 0.2% while the second has an expense ratio of 0.15%. Wouldn't this imply that QQQM would always have a higher NAV than QQQ? How does Invesco ensure the prices don't diverge endlessly? How do they both always have the same returns as the NASDAQ 100 if their NAV is continuously diverging?

"I've been in the following positions since 2011 and my FA has done nothing to exit them since 2018 when I hired them. I'm not confident enough to fire them right now, but my portfolio is high right now and it seems like a great time to get out of these mutual funds. These are just my AF holdings, btw.

  
I'd like to work with my FA to sell them and strategize new positions to get into, however, i don't fully understand why these are bad and how to know the new positions they suggest are good. I can see clearly that they have underperformed against the S&amp;P. I've also heard folks on here say they these funds are expensive. How do I analyze that so I can make a case for myself and get into new positions i'm happy with and eventually fire my FA? And beyond those two angles, what else is wrong with these mutual funds, besides the fact that my FA is likely getting additional fees beyond the 1% they are charging me?

  
All of that being said, i am digging into the research tools provided in this sub. I just need a little advise so i can make a quick move next year to get out of these positions in case the market pulls back a bit. I genuinely want out of these funds regardless.

"Wanted to share some thought on how to pick stocks in technology. I want to focus on the quality of revenue. I did t know this until I spoke with a few experts and got me thinking about fraud and if there is a method to spot fraud in technology consistently. 

I was brought up in the UK in the 90s and 00s where some managers made a fortune by investing in internet companies. Most of those people were long only investors and the horizon was super long. Their main thesis was around changes in society, habitual changes, that would have led to some internet companies to show abnormal growth in stock price. Amazon, Google, FB, Microsoft etc. These managers literally became millionaires. 

The legacy of these managers dies hard and there are many money managers betting on healthcare tech (bio tech), food industries or energy transition. Their bets are almost always driven by top down analysis, instead of understanding the operations of each company. Most of these firms generate their money from licensing. 

Licensing revenue has distinct characteristics such as
- multi year firm wide contract 
- cost of switching tends to be expensive 
- once signed, your revenue is basically guaranteed for a good few years 

One often overlooked is the fact that companies have a great leeway on when to book/show sales and cancellations in their book if and when these multi year licensing contracts get cancelled.

Imagine a hypothetical scenario where a firm sells a licensing agreement. The customer gives a notice or intent to cancel this licensing agreement at the end of the term or even in the middle of it for whatever reasons.  
- there is often penalty involved in early termination 
- the notice period is longer often in months

How does this cancellation appear in your quarterly or semi annual reports?

For this potential loss to appear in the official report, you would need this cancellation to be passed to a relevant department and recorded. 

How does a customer give a notice to the firm of the intention to cancel the licensing agreement? Through their sales or relationship contact. 

Once the sales team receives this cancellation, is there a process that gets initiated or can the sales team decide when to pass this cancellation notice to their management? 

This cancellation doesn’t look good on the sales team that covers that region or customer type. Particularly if the contract amount was large, the bonus would be impacted. The sales team often starts a campaign to minimize the impact of the cancellation or at least understand why the contract is being terminated. These campaigns, due to the nature of the contract, could run months, right up to the date of the actual cancellation. And from what I hear, not very effective use of the sales teams time. 

At what point, is the sales team forced to record this cancellation in their book? I think they will delay recording this loss of revenue till the very last day or they try to smooth the loss by booking this loss when there is a significant gain in revenue (new contract for example). 

Does the same happen to new customer acquisitions? It could. Maybe preferable to record a new sale in certain months, due to accounting or reporting reasons, or bonus reasons. 

For these reasons, technology firms revenue sometimes appears incredibly smooth, smooth because they are cooked, not by management of the firm that might have no knowledge of the book cooking of this nature, but rather on the ground by those who carry out day to day jobs. 

This makes me want to spot firms without proper governance to short them. Firms seemingly doing well are the targets. Firms that rely on a few products are the targets instead of large diversified firms. 

Eventually I think regulators will step in, but at the moment, they don’t seem to have much clue around technology licensing businesses.

"At previous employers, I always understood matching to be based on percentage of your total salary.  So for example, let's say my employer had a 100% match for the first 3%, and 50% for the second 2%.  To keep things easy let's assume my salary is $100k.  Let's say I maxed out my 401k contributions in 2023 ($23,500).  I would understand this to mean that my employer would pay $3000 for the first stage of the match (i.e., 3% of my salary), and $1000 for the second tier (i.e., 50% of 2% of my salary).  So, the total ""match"" I would have gotten in this 2023 hypothetical would be $4000.

Looking at benefits information for a new job, the verbiage threw me off a bit.  It says ""Match formula:  100% of the first 3% of deferral, 50% of the next 2% of deferrals.  Catch-up contributions matched: Yes.""  This seems to base the match not on a percentage of my salary, but on a percentage of the sum that I contribute to my 401k in the year.  So to keep the same figures int he 2023 hypothetical above, it seems like the match would be $705 for the first contribution tier (i.e., 100% of 3% of the $23,500 I contributed); and $235 for the second tier (i.e., 50% of 2% of the $23,500 I contributed).  

Is this right?  While a match is a match, the difference between a &gt;$1000 match and a $4000 match for someone maxing out their 401k and making $100k is pretty substantial, so I'm not sure if I'm just misunderstanding this or if the wording in the benefits package was just in-artful.  

I'd love any clarification from someone who understands this better than I do and is willing to offer it.

"Not sure if the title is aptly stated. I have traditionally avoided mutual funds partly because I read that actively managed funds - in the long run - underperform the Dow/S&amp;P/Nasdaq. I would like to move some funds into vehicles that track the performance of the S&amp;P (maybe 1/3 of the funds) and NASDAQ (other 2/3). However, I want to avoid two things if at all possible:

1) In-fund selling that results in taxable events for me. My understanding is that in “traditional” mutual funds, when managers sell out of ABC stock and pick up XYZ stock, if ABC was sold at a profit, then I get a year-end tax bill for that event…correct? I’m trying to avoid that sort of thing.

2) I think funds get hammered when the market declines or tanks. That’s when investors start redeeming their fund “shares”, which prompts the fund managers to sell holdings while values are low. I do NOT want that. I believe the time to buy is when people are running for the hills. Everyone says that of course (but low, sell high!) but in my experience people tend to act like a herd.

Perhaps I can instead buy a small piece of land (I live in Belgium) and rent it out to those who want to camp or park their vehicles or any other legitimate target audience. Any tips are welcome! What about REITs?

"My portfolio has elements of all-weather, with some conviction picks mixed in 

Basically

25% Nasdaq   
15% Long Term T-Bills  
15% Gold   
15% Consumer Staples  
10% Energy   
10% US Manufacturing - Conviction   
10% Indian Equities - Conviction 

Other than Consumer Staples and Energy, 2023 has been a very profitable year for me thanks to the december rally and my conviction picks playing out well   


1. For 2024, I'm still quite bullish on any stocks or ETFs related to the re-shoring theme in general as its an election year and it seems made-in-america is a slogan that will be a crying call for both parties. I think we're still in the early innings of a manufacturing resurgence in america and this theme can be milked for at least 1-2 years more before valuations become uncomfortably high 
2. I'm also maintaining my bullish stance on Indian equities even despite lofty valuations because many forget that India is largely a self-reliant, self-contained economy that can rely on domestic consumption to weather through any potential global slowdowns. Plus such domestic reliance helps a ton in a world of de-globalization (not to mention the added benefits of being touted as the next manufacturing centre of the world) I know that a lot of parties are looking to short Indian equities through a myriad of roundabout ways, but I think they may be in for a nasty surprise as the growth story continues 
3. Lastly, I'm thinking of adding some fx-unhedged japanese equities into my conviction mix. Departure from YCC, departure from decades long disinlation, and a growing need for a exit strategy will prompt the BOJ to begin lifting its negative real rates. The Yen has deviated close to 20% from its historical average against the dollar. Japanese equities have never looked better in terms of profit prospects. Capex spending is flowing once again. So to benefit from a double whammy of a strengthening yen and continued positive momentum of japanese stocks, I was thinking the fx-unhedged approach was valid.

"I’m sure you get this all the time. If this is redundant please direct me to a thread!

I work for a company and we get RSUs which 1/3 vest each year or something. We also get a little bonus dependent on metrics. 

I was thinking of investing all of it. Obviously I can take no action and RSUs automatically get rolled into 401k according to leadership.

I was also thinking of selling them and just investing by myself in Robinhood maybe QQQ, VGT or IBLC or something. The problem with this is I’m not that comfortable with managing the numbers. I’m fine with just dumping money in and letting Robinhood  send me a form with how much to save if I were to cash out all at once. I wouldn’t be trading around much mostly letting it ride on whichever diversified funds. 

Third option is to get a broker to manage for me maybe the same one that does my 401k. Not sure if the fees would be terrible if I’m not adding that much very often or if my gains would be limited and not able to say “hey throw some at this etf/index”. 

I know if I save $$&amp; in my savings or checking account it will be GONE. 

Just want a good way to semi-automatically invest $500/month or up to $7,000 a yr. I’m a little unsure of the high management fee of the IBLC etf. I’m fine with a solid 7% return from a managed account. But damn some of these tickers are like 30%- 300% in a year!!!  Of course recession, wwiii and de dollarization can all threaten gains.

I recently got lucky on Stake and won a low five-figure sum ($16k to be exact). Pretty stoked about it, but here's the thing: I know I have a tendency to gamble. I don't want to blow this through more betting or rash investing. I'm looking for some advice on how to put this money to good use in a way that's less likely to fuel my gambling habits. 

I've heard about index funds, ETFs, and the likes as more stable investment options. But I'm pretty new to this and not sure where to start. Also, I already have an emergency fund, but I don't want to add more cash.

Does selling my VOO and DCA into TQQQ make sense? Wouldn't this technically be more lucrative for a young bullish guy?

"I know people these days are complaining about high government debt loads now due to high-ish interest rates, but those are the same people who complained about high corporate/personal debt loads during near-zero interest rates. This shift is not coincidence as banks charge the rate the Feds are offerring plus an appropriate bonus based on the risk. Ergo when the Feds raise rates  the risk load in the economy simply shifts from the private sector to the public sector. By extension it could be said that ultimately interest rates and average/public debt loads do not matter simply because the economy is going to tollerate whatever amount of risk that it wants and there's nothing anyone can do about it.

It is likewise important to remember that borrowed money is far from the only risk around because of operational risk. Most loans ultimately go to relatively safe ventures like buying a house or building a factory. I won't name any names, but there are developed nations with high debt loads considered safe while there are third world states with state-run piracy that are considered risky with miniscule debt loads. All that said, why should anyone care whether risk is carried by governments or corporations?","Average debt loads don't matter, prove me wrong.",18vpa78,1704084648.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/18vpa78/average_debt_loads_dont_matter_prove_me_wrong/,
"In the past I have found that tax programs that are supposed to be able to import transaction data from your brokerage do not always work as they should, and the process is fraught with errors which are time-consuming to locate and correct.

Here is a handy program I found which may make this easier.

It is inexpensive and it works! I have already used it to assist in importing my 2023 transactions, saving me lots of time and grief.

"I have a relative who is willing to give me a few thousand dollars to invest for my baby who is 1yr old. 

My goal is to invest $5,000 up front.

Problem is I don't know where to even start. I have a schwab brokerage account but I never use it and I only have $1000 in it. 

The reason I bring up the amount of money I have in it is because I might want to utilize their financial planners but I have to call them and see how that works.

The issue is I just don't know where to even start. I have read that a 529 plan is the best thing, but I don't like how that limits your child to only spending money on their education. Although I want my child to be educated, I'm not sure what the world will be like in 20 years. I'm not sure if people will go to trade schools or do something different than college like they do now. I don't want him to be limited with what he can do with the money, especially because things are always changing and I don't want the money to be frozen up because he can't use it for what he wants.

I've also been told about CDs. And also just investing in the s&amp;p 500 index and just letting it accumulate from there.

I don't even know what my goal should be. He's already one years old. So let's say that I want to give him the money when he's 18, 19 or 20. So that gives me roughly the most 19 years to accumulate this money.

Or maybe it would be better if I gave him money at 25? I don't know. I know the brain develops at 25 lol

Can anyone point me in the right direction on where to start with this. Also what is your personal preference? Do most people think that the 529 plan is the smartest route to go? Should I do a mix of a 529 plan and investing in the s&amp;p 500 index.

Or should I do something entirely different? I have absolutely no experience and investing so I don't even know what half the stuff means.",Investing for my child's future,18vgfo3,1704054729.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/18vgfo3/investing_for_my_childs_future/,
